   CHAPTER I. <br />Getting Ready For the Hunt.
</h2>

<p>“So you are nearly out of fresh meat, are
you? Do your men get that way
often?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. These Pawnee scouts can’t eat
like white men. When they have any fresh
meat on hand they eat all they can, and when
it is gone they look to us for more.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I shall have to send an
officer out after some. I think I will try
Lieutenant Parker. He has been a pretty
good young officer since he has been out here,
and perhaps it will do him some good to get a
little exercise. Orderly, send Parker here.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place between Col.
Dodge, the commander of a small fort situated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">Page&nbsp;2</span>
on the outskirts of the Standing Rock
Agency, and his commissary, who had come
in to report the condition of the garrison in
regard to supplies. There was plenty of
everything except fresh meat, and their Pawnee
scouts were already grumbling over their
diminished supply. Their commander must
send out and get some more. Game of all
kinds was abundant a short distance back in
the mountains, but it was a little dangerous to
send a body of troops out there. Something
out of the usual order of things had happened
within a few miles of Fort Scott, and there
was every indication that Sitting Bull, who
had settled down at Standing Rock Agency
since he came from Canada, was trying to set
his braves against the whites and drive them
from the country. The thing which started
this trouble was the Ghost Dance—something
more of which we shall hear further on.</p>

<p>The orderly disappeared, and presently a
quick step sounded in the hall, the door
opened, and Lieutenant Parker entered.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that this young officer had
proved himself a good soldier, for he came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">Page&nbsp;3</span>
from West Point, and it was plain that he
could not be otherwise. To begin with, he
was handsome above most men of his rank,
with a well-knit figure, and eyes that looked
straight into your own when he was speaking
to you. He stood among the first five
in his class, and upon graduation received
his appointment to the —th Cavalry at Fort
Scott. Of course he found army life dull, compared
with the life he had led at the Point,
but that made no difference to him. If
he lived he would in process of time become
a major-general, and that was what he was
working for. He first saluted the colonel,
then removed his cap and waited for him to
speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Parker, you find this army life
slow, don’t you?” said he.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, sir,” said the lieutenant with
a smile. “One does not get much chance to
stir around.”</p>

<p>“You know the reason for it, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Sitting Bull is going to make
trouble.”</p>

<p>“He has not made any trouble yet, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">Page&nbsp;4</span>
propose to send you out in the presence of all
his warriors.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” replied Parker.</p>

<p>Most young officers would have opened
their eyes when they heard this, but it did not
seem to affect Lieutenant Parker one way or
the other. He knew his commander had
some good reason for it, and with that he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the colonel, “I propose
to give you command of a dozen men, including
a sergeant, two corporals, two wagons and
a guide, and send you into the mountains
after some fresh meat. We got some only a
little while ago, but the Pawnee scouts have
eaten it all up.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker grew interested at once.
He was a pretty fair shot for a boy of his age,
and had brought his Winchester from the
States, together with a fine horse that his
father had given him; but he put his rifle
upon some pegs in his room, and there it had
remained ever since he had been at the fort.
He looked at it once in a while and said to
his room-mate:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">Page&nbsp;5</span></p>

<p>“That Winchester can rust itself out before
I will have a chance to use it. I was in hopes
I should have a chance to try it on a buffalo
before this time.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you have not read the
papers very closely,” said Lieutenant Randolph,
“or you would have found out that the
buffalo have all but disappeared. There is
only one small herd left, and they are in Yellowstone
Park, where they are protected by
law.”</p>

<p>“But there are antelope on the plains,”
said Parker.</p>

<p>“Yes, and maybe you will have a chance
at them by the time old Sitting Bull gets
over his antics. It won’t do for a small company
of men to go out on the plains now.
The Sioux are too active.”</p>

<p>“Well, the colonel knows best,” said Parker
with a sigh. “I have asked him twice to
let me go out but he has always refused me,
and now I shall not ask him again.”</p>

<p>But now the colonel seemed to have thought
better of it, and was going to send him out to
try his skill on some of the big game that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">Page&nbsp;6</span>
was always to be found in the foothills. He
was delighted to hear it, and his delight
showed itself in his face.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can get some meat for
us?” asked the colonel with a smile. “You
appear to think that you are going to have an
easy time of it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I suppose we shall have a hard
time in getting what we want; but if you can
give me a guide who will show me where the
game is, I believe I will have some for you
when I come back.”</p>

<p>“How will Carl, the Trailer, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I have often seen him
about the fort, but have never spoken to him.”</p>

<p>“We will put two boys at the head of the
expedition, and see how they will come out
with the captain who went out two weeks ago,”
said the colonel, turning to his commissary.
“Sit down, Parker. Orderly, tell Carl, the
Trailer, that I want to see him.”</p>

<p>The orderly opened the door and went out,
and Lieutenant Parker took the chair toward
which the colonel waved his hand. While
they were waiting for the guide the officer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">Page&nbsp;7</span>
proceeded to give his subordinate some instructions
in regard to the way he was to conduct
himself in case the Sioux molested him. Of
course he could not expect, with the few men
that the colonel was going to give him, to
stand against the whole body of the Sioux,
but he could run, holding a tight rein in the
meantime, until he came to a clear spot free
from gullies and underbrush, and there he
could dismount his command and make the
best fight possible. If he wasn’t back at the
fort in a week a company would be sent out
to look for him; but suppose he was found
dead and scalped? Lieutenant Parker thought
of this, but his ardor did not abate in the
least. He had come out on the plains to take
just such risks as this, and he supposed that
it was the orders every young officer received
when he was about to encounter the Indians
for the first time. But he did not believe that
the Sioux were going to get after him. They
had enough to do with the Ghost Dance to
prevent them paying attention to anything
else.</p>

<p>“But I hope they will keep clear of you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">Page&nbsp;8</span>
until you come back,” said the colonel. “The
first thing you do, go to work and fill up one
of those wagons with game and send it to the
fort with six men, commanded by the corporal.
He knows the way and won’t get lost. After
that, you stay with the other six men until
you fill up the other wagon, and then come
home yourself.”</p>

<p>Just then another step was heard in the
hall, and the door opened to admit Carl, the
Trailer. Parker told himself that he was glad
that Carl was going with him as guide, for
he would have opportunity to talk to him, and
perhaps he might find out where he got that
curious name.</p>

<p>Carl was young in years—he did not look
to be a day older than Lieutenant Parker—and
the years of toil and hardship he had seen
on the plains, if indeed he had seen any of
them, did not mar his face as they had that
of older scouts. He was as straight as an
arrow, bore a frank and honest face, and his
blue eyes, as he turned them from one to
another of the occupants of the room, did not
express the least surprise that he had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">Page&nbsp;9</span>
called upon to go on a dangerous mission.
He supposed that the colonel wished to send
him to Standing Rock Agency with dispatches,
and he was ready to take them. It was something
that he had frequently been called upon
to do, and he had always returned in safety.
He did not look like a plainsman, for he was
dressed in a suit of moleskin, as fine a pair
of boots as money could buy, and a sombrero,
which he removed as he entered the room.</p>

<p>“Here I am, colonel,” said he cheerily, “and
all ready to go on to Fort Yates, if necessary.
What do you want of me?”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with Lieutenant
Parker?” asked the colonel in reply.</p>

<p>“I have seen him, but I don’t know him,”
answered the guide.</p>

<p>“Well, here he is. Lieutenant, this is Carl,
the Trailer, the name by which you will probably
know him, but his name is Preston.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant got up from his chair and
extended his hand to the guide, but was
not very well pleased with the reception he
met. Carl took his hand, gave it a little
squeeze and dropped it, and then turned his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">Page&nbsp;10</span>
face toward the colonel and waited for him
to go on and explain what he wanted done.
There were two things about it, Lieutenant
Parker told himself: Carl was not favorably
impressed with his appearance; and, furthermore,
he could not have been raised in that
country all his life, for he used as fine language
as he did himself.</p>

<p>“Carl, I want you to guide twelve men to
the foothills and get some fresh meat for us,”
continued the colonel.</p>

<p>At this the guide turned again and gave
the lieutenant a good looking over. It seemed
to be the first time that he had taken a fair
view of him. He surveyed him all over, from
his boots to his head, gazed straight into his
eyes for a moment, and then turned his attention
to the colonel again.</p>

<p>“Do you think the lieutenant will do?”
asked the officer.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; provided a grizzly don’t get
after him and tear him up,” replied the guide
with indifference.</p>

<p>“But you must not let a grizzly do that.
If you start now you can easily reach Lost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">Page&nbsp;11</span>
River, can’t you? Very well. You may get
ready, and the commissary will find the
wagons and mules for you and twelve hunters.
Be sure you pick out the best shots in the
command.”</p>

<p>The commissary and the guide went out, and
Parker was alone with the colonel. The officer
looked into the lieutenant’s face as he took his
chair again, and could not repress a smile at
the expression of disappointment he saw there.</p>

<p>“Well, Parker, what do you think of Carl,
the Trailer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think more of him than he does of me,
sir,” replied the lieutenant. “He doesn’t
hold me in very high estimation as a hunter.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>Parker did not know what reply to make
to this. He looked at the colonel, and then
his gaze wandered down to the floor.</p>

<p>“You must do something to prove yourself
a good shot and a man who can bag game
every time he sees it,” continued the officer.
“Do your part of the work faithfully, and I
warrant he will come back with a different
opinion of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">Page&nbsp;12</span></p>

<p>“But, colonel, that fellow was never born
and raised in this country.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that? On account
of his language? He was born in this country,
about forty miles from here. His father was
a Harvard graduate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that accounts for it, sir. Has this
Carl, the Trailer, ever been to school?”</p>

<p>“Never a day in his life. He despised
school and everything connected with it, and
longed for horses, guns and excitement. I
guess he has seen plenty of it. His father
died about two years ago, and he left his ranch
in charge of a foreman and has been on duty
at this post ever since.”</p>

<p>“He does not dress at all like a plainsman,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Carl is rich. I don’t suppose he
knows how many cattle there are, running
loose on the plains, that bear his brand. But
if all reports are true he is not going to be
allowed to keep his money for a great while.
There are some fellows about here who
wouldn’t be any too sorry to see him deliver
up his life, for then the property would come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">Page&nbsp;13</span>
into their possession. But he bears a charmed
existence in spite of all they can do. I guess
I have told you everything I could think of,
and you may as well get ready and go on.
Remember, I want you to fill up one of the
wagons at once and send it to me in command
of a corporal. I shall look for you to come
back in safety at the end of a week, if you
don’t get all the game you want before that
time, and I shall expect to hear a good account
of you.”</p>

<p>The colonel arose to his feet, and the lieutenant,
taking this as a hint that he wanted
the interview brought to a close, shook hands
with him and hurried out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">Page&nbsp;14</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II. <br />Carl, the Trailer.</h2>

<p>At the door Lieutenant Parker found the
officer who was acting as commissary
of the post waiting for him.</p>

<p>“I have not picked out your men yet,”
said he. “I didn’t know but you had some
men in your own company you would be glad
to have along with you.”</p>

<p>“I have indeed,” said the lieutenant. “I
would be obliged to you if you would let Sergeant
Leeds go with the hunters to take command
of them. As for the two corporals,
Mason and Smith will do as well as anybody.
As for the hunters——”</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and then named
over twelve of the best shots in the company
whom he would like to have with him, and
then hastened off to get his hunting equipments
together and to saddle his horse, for
be it known that it was against the law for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">Page&nbsp;15</span>
an officer to hire an enlisted man to take care
of his stock. He was obliged to act as his own
servant or his work would not be done. He
ran into his own room, where Lieutenant Randolph
was lying on the bed reading a novel, and
began taking his Winchester down from the
pegs on which it had hung for so long a time.</p>

<p>“Come here, old fellow,” said he gleefully.
“We are going to see what you can do now.
If you don’t shoot everything you are pointed
at——”</p>

<p>“Has the colonel given you permission to
go hunting?” asked the lieutenant in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He sent for me on purpose to
tell me to go to the foothills and shoot some
big game for the post,” said Parker. “I guess
those Pawnee gluttons must be pretty nearly
out.”</p>

<p>“Now I don’t see why it is that I don’t get
an invitation to go on such an expedition as
this,” said Lieutenant Randolph, flinging his
book across the room and stretching himself
out with his hands under his head. “I have
always tried to be a good and loyal soldier of
the Republic——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">Page&nbsp;16</span></p>

<p>“Always?” said Parker, with a sly look at
his companion. “When you appeared on
dress parade with your horse’s legs covered
with dust, and your necktie all adrift instead
of being tied up as it ought to be, did you
think you were setting a proper example to
the men?”</p>

<p>“But the colonel did not say anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“No, but the captain did, and of course the
colonel knew it. The captain gave you something
of a blessing, too, judging by the looks
your face wore when you came into this
room.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Randolph did not say anything,
for he knew it was all true. They were just
as strict in the army where there were no
visitors to see them as they were at West
Point. He had come out there to join the
—th Cavalry at the same time Parker did,
and his room-mate ranked him just about five
minutes; that is, Parker’s appointment was
signed before Randolph’s was. But the same
habits that clung to him at West Point followed
him here. He was just a moment too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">Page&nbsp;17</span>
late for everything, and the colonel thought
that keeping him in while the other officers
were allowed privileges would in time cure
him of his bad habits. He lay on his bed
and watched Parker while he filled his belt
with cartridges and hastily put some extra
clothes into a small valise which he intended
to take with him, and then he went out to
saddle his horse.</p>

<p>By the time Lieutenant Parker emerged
from the stable the expedition was ready to
start. The drivers were in their seats on the
wagons, and the twelve hunters, with Sergeant
Leeds at their head, were waiting for him.
Carl, the Trailer, was there, superbly mounted,
and when Lieutenant Parker led his horse up,
he surveyed the animal with rather a critical
eye. The conclusion he came to was not very
favorable to Parker’s Kentucky thoroughbred.
He said to himself that if the two horses were
ever put into a race he was sure that his own
mustang would win every time.</p>

<p>Parker’s rifle and valise were on the porch,
and it did not take him long to deposit them
in one of the wagons; then he saluted his superiors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">Page&nbsp;18</span>
several of whom had gathered on the
steps beside the colonel to witness his departure,
kissed his hand to some of the second
lieutenants, and swung himself into the saddle.
“Forward!” said the sergeant, and
in a few minutes more the little train had
passed through the gate and wended its way
toward the foothills, which lay all of thirty
miles away. Then Parker turned his attention
to Carl, the Trailer, who rode by his side
in the rear of the wagons.</p>

<p>If he was an object worthy of admiration
to Lieutenant Parker while he was afoot, he
demanded extra admiration now that he was
on horseback. His sombrero sat jauntily
over his long, curly hair, his Winchester was
confined by a strap at his back, leaving his
hands, which were protected by gauntlet
gloves, free to manage his horse, and the face
he turned toward Lieutenant Parker was as
handsome as a girl’s. The two boys looked
at each other in silence for a moment, and
then the lieutenant said:</p>

<p>“You seem rather young to go on an expedition
like this.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">Page&nbsp;19</span></p>
<p>“And so do you,” returned Carl. “When
the colonel sent for me I had made up my
mind to do something desperate. I was sure
he was going to send me to Fort Yates with
dispatches; but when I found that he was
going to send me out after game—why, I
thought he would send a man with me; that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t suppose I shall fill the bill,”
said Parker, modestly. “I lack some years
yet of being a man. What do you expect me
to do while you fellows are hunting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will loaf around the camp bossing
the job, eat more than your share of the grub,
and when we get back to the fort you will
brag as loudly as though you had done something.
If we should accidentally kill a bear,
you would appropriate the hide and proudly
exhibit it as your own. That is the way the
young officers always do.”</p>

<p>“Then you have had some experience with
them?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I remember shooting a bull
elk while out once with a second lieutenant,
who offered me twenty-five dollars if I would
say that he killed the elk himself. You
know the man. You have seen him every
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">Page&nbsp;20</span></p>

<p>“I cannot think who you refer to, for I
don’t know of any officer who has got a pair
of antlers in his room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has sent them home.”</p>

<p>“Then I am glad I don’t know him, and I
shall make no effort to find him out.”</p>

<p>Carl, the Trailer, looked at Parker with a
smile of disbelief on his face.</p>

<p>“I mean it,” said the lieutenant earnestly.
“I should not care to associate with any man
who could tell a lie like that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the colonel knows it, and that was
the reason he selected you to command this
expedition.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why he selected me unless it
was because I have always tried to do my
duty. This is his way of telling a young
officer that he is satisfied with him. Would
you mind telling me how you came by your
odd name—Carl, the Trailer?” added Parker,
who was anxious to change the subject of the
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">Page&nbsp;21</span></p>

<p>“It was nothing at all, only just because I
happened to do my business as I ought to
have done it,” said Carl, “although I felt
proud of it at the time I did it.”</p>

<p>With this he threw his leg over the pommel
of his saddle, produced a well-worn brier-root
from his pocket, and proceeded to fill up for a
smoke. When he had got his pipe fairly
lighted he went on with his story something
in this way:</p>

<p>It all happened a few years ago, when Carl
was, as he considered himself, a little boy.
He was the only scout at the fort, and it became
necessary to send some dispatches to
Fort Belknap. The fort was just on the outskirts
of the Comanche country, and they
were pretty hostile, and felt exceedingly vindictive
toward anybody with white blood in
their veins. Carl did not know much about
the country, having never been down there
but once, but he knew how to trail Indians.
In fact, he could not remember the time when
he couldn’t do it. On the way he fell in with
a troop of soldiers who were out punishing
the savages for some outrage they had committed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">Page&nbsp;22</span>
on the settlers, and as they were
journeying toward the fort he kept company
with them, and he never regretted it but once
in his life. The company were all green; not
even the officers had ever been out after
Indians before, and Carl did not know why it
was that the Indians did not make an assault
upon them. The Indians were all around
them; they could not help but see them, for
they were on the summit of high swells looking
at the troops, and at night they took extra
pains to make a camp where they thought no
Indians could surprise them.</p>

<p>Carl interrupted himself right here to say
that if there was anybody on earth who could
beat a Comanche in stealing horses, he had
yet to hear of him. He would go inside a
camp that was double guarded, get away with
the best horse that could be found, and nobody
would be the wiser for it until morning, by
which time the Comanche would be so far
away, and cover up his trail no nicely, that
pursuit was impossible. When the time came
for the soldiers to go to bed, he brought his
horse in from the stable-lines and made his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">Page&nbsp;23</span>
lariat fast to his wrist. Then he would go to
sleep, knowing that if any Indians came about,
his horse would be certain to awaken him.
They always had extra sentries out, and Carl
felt perfectly safe.</p>

<p>One night, after the guide had been with
the soldiers about three or four days, he was
awakened about twelve o’clock by a terrible
hubbub in camp. He started up and grabbed
his lariat, and found that his horse was safe;
but that was more than a dozen men could
tell, all owning the best stock, too. A good
many men had followed his example and tied
their horses fast to them, but every one of
them found his lariat cut and his horse gone.
Of course those Comanches must be overtaken
and punished for stealing their horses, but it
seemed that Carl was the only one in camp
who knew how to follow the trail. The commanding
officer did not know it until he told
him. When daylight came half the soldiers
were out examining the trails, and they all
led away in different directions.</p>

<p>“It is of no use, men,” said the captain.
“The trails branch out every which way, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">Page&nbsp;24</span>
those of us who have lost our horses will have
to go to the fort on foot.”</p>

<p>That was the time for Carl to make known
one of his accomplishments.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said he, “I can lead the men
in three days to the place where these trails
will all come together again.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at him in surprise, and
during that time he surveyed him from head
to foot. No doubt he thought that, for one
of his years, he was talking a little too big;
but after thinking a moment he ordered breakfast
got ready and told the guide to go ahead.</p>

<p>“You say you have lived on the plains all
your life,” said he. “Then you must have
seen Indian trails before. Be sure you don’t
disappoint me now.”</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the cavalcade started, and
for the first fifty miles Carl never followed a
single trail. He kept right ahead toward a
prominent butte that could be seen in the distance,
and the captain, although he did not
put much faith in him, allowed him to do as
he pleased. The soldiers camped that night—and
a sorry camp it was, too; they had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">Page&nbsp;25</span>
fire to cook their grub by, and, worse than all,
the boys had to do without a smoke—and
about nine o’clock the next morning the guide
found first one trail and then another, until
he counted the tracks of a dozen shod horses.
Carl looked at the captain, who reached over
and shook hands with him.</p>

<p>“You see he was green,” said Carl in an
attempt to shield the captain. “He learned
something during the time he was out with
me, and when I came to go with him a second
time he did not ask any help. He could follow
the trail himself.”</p>

<p>“In two days from now, if nothing happens
to prevent, you will have the satisfaction of
shooting at the Indians who stole your horses,”
said the guide.</p>

<p>A little before dark, while they were riding
swiftly along a rocky trail that here ran
through a gorge, Carl looked down and happened
to see something that brought him to
a standstill. He dismounted, and found that
the dirt had been thrown up and stones
placed upon it to hide it from curious eyes.
He threw aside the stones and began investigating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">Page&nbsp;26</a></span>
with his sheath knife, the soldiers all
standing around and wondering what he was
looking for. A few prods with the knife, and
Carl unearthed the horseshoes which had been
removed by the Indians so that they could not
be followed so easily.</p>

<p>“This beats me,” said the captain. “How
did you know that the shoes were there?”</p>

<p>“I just saw it,” answered the guide. “When
one is following a trail he must keep his eyes
about him. I don’t suppose you know that
there is an Indian watching us over the summit
of that swell, do you?”</p>

<p>The captain was profoundly amazed. He
looked in every direction except the right one,
but could see nothing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">Page&nbsp;27</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III. <br />The Ghost Dance.</h2>

<p>While the guide was engaged in tossing
out the shoes so that the soldiers
could examine them he kept his eyes busy,
and finally discovered something that fastened
his gaze. It looked like a tuft of grass on the
top of a swell, but as Carl looked at it he saw
it move just a trifle. He was as certain as he
wanted to be that there was an Indian behind
that grass. He was watching the soldiers,
and he had pulled up that grass to conceal the
movements of his head.</p>

<p>“You are joking, ain’t you?” said the captain.</p>

<p>“I don’t joke in a case like this,” said the
guide. “There is an Indian up there, and
he wants to see what we are going to do.”</p>

<p>Carl pointed out the object that drew his
attention, and the captain brought his binoculars
to bear upon it. After gazing at it for a
long time he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">Page&nbsp;28</span></p>

<p>“I see some grass up there.”</p>

<p>“That’s grass, but there is a Comanche not
far off. My advice would be to turn around and
ride the other way as though we had missed
the trail, and hide behind some of these swells
until that tuft of grass goes away. That will
give them confidence in themselves, and as soon
as it comes dark we’ll take the trail again.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose you can follow this
trail in the night-time, do you?”</p>

<p>“I can try,” said the guide, modestly.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly the captain gave the order
to turn about, and in the course of an hour
they got behind one of the swells, out of sight.
Then the guide told the captain that if he
would go back with him he would show him
something. The officer left the command behind
the swells, and after a long and toilsome
creep up the hill they took off their hats and
Carl made a hole in the grass for him to see
through.</p>

<p>“I see that tuft of grass yet,” said the captain,
looking through his binoculars.</p>

<p>“So do I; but if you watch it for a few
minutes you will see it go away.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">Page&nbsp;29</span></p>
<p>They watched that swell for more than half
an hour, and then the tuft of grass was laid
aside, and the Indian showed his head and
breast above the hill. He held that position
for five or ten minutes, and then jumped to
his feet and ran out of sight. The captain
was much amazed to learn how easily Carl
had picked out some grass that sheltered an
Indian, and declared that if the guide had not
been with him he never would have seen those
Comanches again. They made their camp
there behind the swell, eating hardtack and
raw pork for want of a fire to cook by, and
shortly after dark started on the trail again.
At midnight the men stopped to rest, and Carl
set out with a single soldier to hunt up the
Indians’ camp. Of course it was miserable
going, with rocks and trees to impede their
progress, but finally they came to the end
of the gorge, and there Carl smelled smoke.
The Indian camp was around there somewhere,
so the guide left the soldier and went
on ahead.</p>

<p>“I tell you there is no fun in creeping up
on an Indian camp in the dead of night when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">Page&nbsp;30</span>
you don’t know how many savages there are
watching you,” said Carl, once more interrupting
himself in his story. “I made out
that there were just three Indians in the lot——”</p>

<p>“How did you make that out?” said Lieutenant
Parker.</p>

<p>“They had to dismount when they went
into camp, didn’t they?” asked Carl. “That
was the time I counted them. I found three
moccasin tracks of different sizes, and that’s
the way I found out how many of them there
were.”</p>

<p>“Three Indians go into a camp of—how
many men did you say you had?”</p>

<p>“About sixty, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“The idea of three Indians going into a
camp of sixty soldiers and stealing a dozen
horses!” said Parker, in surprise. “They
must have been horse-thieves indeed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can tell you worse things than
that,” said Carl. “Yes; the three savages
went into that camp and stole a dozen horses,
and now we were close onto them. When I
reached a point a little farther on I came to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">Page&nbsp;31</span>
an open space in the gully, and there I saw
their camp fire. I took just one look at it, and
then turned and went back. Of course the
camp was alive after they found that I had located
the Indians. Three or four men were
left to care for the horses, and the rest of us
crept forward to make the attack. The captain
would not listen to my advice in regard
to surrounding the camp, but when he arrived
within sight of it he was going to make a rush,
and kill or capture the Indians right there.
That settled one thing in my mind. The captain
may have been a brave man, but he was
going to find an empty camp when they
charged upon it; but I said nothing. If he
had a mind to ride two hundred miles to turn
the Indians loose, it was nothing to me.”</p>

<p>Carl then proceeded with his story. In the
course of time they arrived within sight of
the fire, and then with a fierce yell the men
bounded to their feet and rushed upon the
camp. For himself, Carl did nothing. He
just waited to find the Comanches, but he did
not hear anybody shoot. After a time he
walked up and found the soldiers rushing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">Page&nbsp;32</span>
frantically about looking for the redskins; but
the last one of them had skipped out.</p>

<p>“Where have they gone?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“They ran when they heard you getting
ready to charge,” said the guide. “You did
pretty well during the pursuit, but you are no
man to fight Indians. You have got your
horses, but you will have to look somewhere
else to find the Comanches.”</p>

<p>The captain was astonished and mortified
beyond measure, as Carl knew he would be if
he attempted to capture the Indians in that
way, but he had but little to say. He sent a
couple of men down after the horses he had
left in the ravine, and ordered the soldiers to
go into camp. It was good to feel the fire once
more, for the nights were getting cold, and to
get some pork that they did not have to devour
raw.</p>

<p>“But how did you get the name of The
Trailer?” asked Parker, when his companion
knocked the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>“Well, you see the soldiers belonging to
that troop were mostly new to the business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">Page&nbsp;33</span>
It was the first time they had ever been on a
scout, and the way I followed the trail was
something marvellous to them. Some of
them had friends in Fort Scott, and when I
went back I took a lot of mail for them. Of
course they had something to say about their
scout after the Comanches, and I came in for
a share of the praise. Some one spoke of me
as Carl, the Trailer, and I have been known
by that name ever since.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you have got all through with
that story, I want to ask you about something
else,” said Lieutenant Parker. “Do you know
anything about the Ghost Dance? Some people
in the East think it is a myth, a new religion
that has been taken up by a few fanatics,
but which will fade away by the time the white
folks quit noticing it.”</p>

<p>“I know all about it,” answered Carl, “fully
as much as the Indians themselves know.
If the people down East think it is a myth,
they want to go among the Sioux at the present
time. They will think there is a dread
reality in it before they have been there very
long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">Page&nbsp;34</span></p>

<p>“It was gotten up for the sake of going to
war with the whites, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, it was not. It was gotten up by
Wovoka, better known as the Cutter. He
was a Piute Indian, and lived on the borders
of the Mason Valley, which is a long way
from here. The time he discovered the new
religion was once when ‘the sun died’ and
he was taken up into the other world.”</p>

<p>“What in the name of sense is the meaning
of that?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“I will tell you how I account for it. About
that time the Cutter, as I shall call him, was
taken very ill with a fever, and some of the
ranchmen attended him. You see he was very
well known by the farmers, used to work for
them, and so when he was sick they did all
they could for him. While he was on what
everybody supposed to be his deathbed the
eclipse of the sun took place, and that is an
event that is regarded with horror by all
primitive people. The Indians hold that the
sun is a living being, and that some monster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">Page&nbsp;35</span>
is trying to devour it; and the noise and hubbub
which they create to frighten this monster
away, such as firing off guns, blowing upon
horns and yelling, is enough to drive one
crazy. The excitement and alarm, acting
upon a mind and body already enfeebled by
disease, resulted in delirium, during which
time he was taken up into the other world.
Between 1884 and 1890 there was one eclipse
which was total in Nevada; that was in 1889.
Ever since that, the Cutter has been subject
to cataleptic fits; and I suppose you know
what they are.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker listened to Carl in silent
admiration. Here was a boy who had never
been to school a day in his life, and yet
knew more about some things than he did.
He began to look upon him with a great deal
of respect.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what catalepsis is,” said Lieutenant
Parker. “It is a sudden suspension
of sensation and volition, the body and limbs
preserving whatever position may be given
them. For example, you put the hand up,
and it stays there till you put it down; or you
put the foot up, and it remains there.”</p>

<p>It was now Carl’s turn to look in surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">Page&nbsp;36</span>
toward the lieutenant. There was something
in West Point after all, if it taught their
young officers such things.</p>

<p>“And when he came to himself I suppose
he was all ready for war,” continued Parker.</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t. The Cutter is a peaceful
man; he has never been seen on the warpath;
when he came back to this earth he
was more for peace than he ever was. He
told his people that they must send their
children to school and cultivate the ways of
the white man as nearly as they could. They
must all love one another and stop fighting.”</p>

<p>“The Sioux don’t take it that way,” said
Parker.</p>

<p>“I will come to the Sioux after awhile,”
said Carl. “Of course such a tale as that
speedily spread to all the tribes round about.
The Piutes gave it to the ones nearest them,
and in less than a year it was spread all over
the plains. It even got to Washington, and
the Department sent out a man to inquire into
it. I might have gone with that man as well
as not, but I was like the majority of our people
out here. We heard of the new religion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">Page&nbsp;37</span>
and laughed at it; but it seems that there was
something in it. Wovoka did not claim to
be the Messiah, but he did claim to be a
dreamer. But an Indian never does anything
without a dance, and he taught them
this thing which has since developed into the
Ghost Dance. To render his visit more binding
he gave the Washington man a cloak of
rabbit skins, some piñon nuts, some tail
feathers of the magpie, and a quantity of red
paint, which they were to mix with red paint
of their own and put on whenever they engaged
in the Ghost Dance.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is the doctrine of the Ghost
Dance, anyway?” asked Lieutenant Parker.</p>

<p>“The doctrine is that the time will come
when the whole Indian race, living and dead,
will reunite upon the earth and live a life of
happiness, free from death, disease and misery.”</p>

<p>“But their game is all gone,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“They can’t live the same as they did before.”</p>

<p>“Their game is going to come back. During
one of his fits the Cutter caught a glimpse of
an immense crowd of warriors coming toward
the earth driving before them a lot of animals—buffalo,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">Page&nbsp;38</span>
deer, elk and ponies. But the Great
Spirit—that is the Messiah—turned them back,
for he said the proper time had not yet come.”</p>

<p>“And the Sioux think this can only come
by extinction of the whites?” inquired Parker.</p>

<p>“The whites must be rooted out before the
time arrives. They are going to keep up this
Ghost Dance to help the matter along. I am
almost to the Sioux now.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Lieutenant
Parker. “I will not interrupt you again, but
I want to get at the truth of the matter.”</p>

<p>“This is just what I want you to do. I
want you to see that, while this new religion
came upon the earth as a gospel of peace, it
has taken such a hold of the Sioux that it
means war. Whether or not the men they
sent out to investigate the matter lied to them
I don’t know; but if this thing is not put a
stop to right away, we are going to have an
outbreak as sure as you are born. If all the
Sioux look upon it as do those six hundred
men that go with Sitting Bull and Red Cloud,
we shall have a war here that will do your
heart good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">Page&nbsp;39</span></p>

<p>“How many men can the Sioux raise if
they all go to war at once?” inquired Parker.</p>

<p>“Probably five thousand men; and we can
bring about three thousand to oppose them.”</p>

<p>“How many people does the Sioux nation
number altogether?”</p>

<p>“About twenty thousand.”</p>

<p>As Carl said this he brought out his tobacco-bag
and filled up for another smoke.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">Page&nbsp;40</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV. <br />The Solitary Horseman.</h2>

<p>“This man, although he was an officer
sent out from Washington to look into
the matter, did many things to help this
trouble along, but he did not know it at the
time,” continued Carl, after drawing a few
vigorous pulls at his pipe to make sure that
the tobacco was well started. “When he
came back he went among the Arapahoes
and Cheyennes, because he had some friends
among them, and he wanted to set their minds
at rest. He told them what Wovoka, the Cutter,
had said to him, claiming that he was not
the Messiah but one who had seen him, and
gave them some of the piñon nuts to eat. You
haven’t seen any of those piñon nuts around
here, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“Well, out in the country where the Piute
Indians live they are used every day for food;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">Page&nbsp;41</span>
and yet those Arapahoes and Cheyennes received
them as if they came from the hands
of the Messiah himself. Those Indians were
anxious to touch this man by the hand and
lay hold of his clothes, believing that if they
but touched the Cutter some good would come
to them. When the man went East to make
his report to Washington, the Arapahoes and
Cheyennes sent some prominent men to investigate
for themselves. They were gone all
winter, and brought back some queer stories
that this man had not told them, because he
did not know anything about them. Finally
the Sioux got hold of it, and became excited at
once. They seemed to think it was what they
had so long been waiting for—a summons to
go to war and wipe the whites off the face of
the earth. They, too, sent out some men, and
they brought back some other strange stories.
One thing the Cutter told them was, that if
they got weary with their journey—Wovoka
lives all of a thousand miles from here—they
had but to call upon the Great Spirit, and he
would set them miles ahead on their route.
Another thing was, that if they killed a buffalo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">Page&nbsp;42</span>
on their journey they were to take everything
except the tail and hoofs, and that after they
got out of sight the buffalo would come to life
again.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker laughed loudly when he
heard it.</p>

<p>“The idea,” he exclaimed. “To think
that twenty thousand people could be fooled
in that way! After a buffalo is dead he is
<em>dead</em>, and nothing can bring him to life again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that the Indian is so
much to blame for that,” said Carl, looking
down at the horn of his saddle. “You know
how susceptible the savage is to superstition.
All his life he has been planning and thinking
about getting rid of the whites. We are
his evil genius; and if we could be driven out
of the country everything would go along as
smoothly as it did before. One of their agents,
in making out his report to Washington, has
twelve different counts against our people.”</p>

<p>“What have we done to the Sioux?” demanded
Parker, opening his eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>“Take, for instance, a supply of goods
which ought to have been here by August but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">Page&nbsp;43</span>
did not get here until midwinter,” said Carl
in reply. “I guess that was enough to set a
more patient people than the Sioux on the
warpath. A good many of them starved to
death in spite of all the army could do to prevent
it. I tell you, you would find it mighty
hard to be loyal to a Government that could
deliberately go back on you in that way.”</p>

<p>“Why, Carl, I did not know you were such
an Indian lover,” said Lieutenant Parker.</p>

<p>“I am an Indian lover in this way: I say
they have been abused, and shamefully, too.
When the Black Hills were given up to
them, they were assured that they should belong
to them and their heirs forever. Everything
went on smoothly until gold was discovered
there, and from that time the trouble
began. Custer was sent through that country,
not with any instructions to turn the settlers
out, but just to examine the spot; and the
consequence was that in less than a year the
Black Hills were overrun with prospectors.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Indians were in our way,” said
Lieutenant Parker. “If they had behaved
themselves——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">Page&nbsp;44</span></p>
<p>“Yes, and seen their buffaloes all killed before
their eyes. I tell you, lieutenant, you
don’t know what a buffalo is to an Indian.
It furnishes him with everything he needs,
including skins for his tepee, robes to keep
him warm in midwinter and sinews for sewing
his clothes together. A white man kills them
just to make a record. Sometimes he takes
their tails home to hang up in his study and
sometimes he don’t. There are but few
buffaloes left, and they are in Yellowstone
Park. I hope the Government will take a
hand in protecting them.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker could not say a word
against this, for he knew it was all true. He
knew how he would feel if some people
stronger than his own should follow him year
after year, take his land away from him, and
destroy the only means he had of making a
living. He had never looked at it in this way
before. He supposed that the redskins were
born with a natural enmity against the whites,
and that nothing could turn them from a desire
to take vengeance on them. He did not know
that he blamed the Indian so much, after all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">Page&nbsp;45</span></p>
<p>“When the Sioux Indians who had been
sent away to inquire into the matter came
back,” continued Carl, “they brought with
them the news that they had seen the Messiah
himself, that they had talked with him,
and that when the proper time came he was
going to help the Indians, and not the
whites.”</p>

<p>“That shows that they meant to get up a
war,” said Parker, forgetting, so deeply was
he interested in the story, that he had promised
not to interrupt any more.</p>

<p>“It certainly looks that way. The Sioux
said he would be here by the time the grass
was green in the spring; but, in order to
speed his coming, they must engage in a dance
which was to last five days.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for the exhaustion that
some of the dancers experience. They go on
until they are completely played out and then
swoon from the effects of it.”</p>

<p>“That is my idea exactly,” said the guide.
“A great many people who have witnessed
the dance lay it to hypnotism. Now, what
does that mean?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">Page&nbsp;46</span></p>
<p>“I don’t know that I can tell you,” said Parker,
after thinking a moment. “It is a certain
form of sleep, brought on by artificial means,
in which there is a suspension of certain
bodily powers and unusual activity of others.
That is as near as I can get at it. And when
they come back to earth again—I don’t know
whether they lie or not—they tell big stories
of what they have seen in the spirit land.”</p>

<p>“And they are going to keep it up until we
go to war with them,” said Carl earnestly.
“You see they have got their homes to fight
for, and when the time comes for the Indians
to take possession of this country, all the
whites and tribes who do not believe as they
do will be overwhelmed by a flood; but the
believers, those who did the dancing, will escape
by fleeing to the tops of the mountains.”</p>

<p>“And Sitting Bull is to blame for that?”</p>

<p>“Yes—and Red Cloud. They are as
strongly in favor of the dance as anyone they
have got under them, and they are keeping
it up in defiance of all the army officers can
say and do against it. They are very sly;
they talk only in their own language, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">Page&nbsp;47</span>
some say that Sitting Bull can sign his name
in English; but I don’t believe it. Nobody
can get at anything an Indian does, and when
this outbreak comes, it will come like an avalanche.”</p>

<p>“All you have said is news to me,” said
Lieutenant Parker thoughtfully. “I believe
that the Ghost Dance is not a myth; but, as
you say, it will lead to something else.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant grew uneasy after that, and
wished his companion would offer some advice
about watching over the men in his little
train; but he did not act as if there was an
Indian within a thousand miles of him. Carl
knew all about the plains and those who inhabited
them, and when he began to be uneasy
it would be time enough for him to do something;
but he thought it would be worth
while to ask some counsel on the subject.</p>

<p>“You said that this outbreak would come
before we are aware of it,” said he. “How do
you know that it will not come on us who are
out hunting?”</p>

<p>“There is little danger of that, unless some
Indian saw us when we left the fort or will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">Page&nbsp;48</span>
run against some of us while we are away
from the camp. This country all belongs to
them, and it would be right and proper that
we should be wiped out.”</p>

<p>Of course Lieutenant Parker did not feel
any easier for asking his guide to express an
opinion on the situation. He did not show it
in his face, but he felt the cold chills run all
over him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he talked that way in
order to frighten me,” thought Parker, “but I
hope that we shall not see any Indians while
we are gone. I would not know how to act.”</p>

<p>The hunters did not stop when they reached
Lost River, but drove past a camp which
those who had gone before them had made
during their hunt in the foothills. The sergeant
did not halt at that camp, for he wanted
a “fresh spot” in which to pass the night.
Half a mile farther on he found a place that
suited him, and there he stopped his men and
rode back to Lieutenant Parker, who had been
riding behind the wagons all the way.</p>

<p>“Will this place suit you, sir?” said he,
with his hand to his cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">Page&nbsp;49</span></p>

<p>The lieutenant dismounted from his horse,
ran his eye up and down the river, and said
the place selected for the camp would answer
the purpose. He directed the sergeant to detail
some of the men to clear away the underbrush,
the others to take care of the horses
and pitch the tents, while he and Carl removed
their saddles and seated themselves at the foot
of the nearest tree to have their talk out.
The tents were pitched, one for himself and
Carl and the other for the men, and one of
the soldiers proceeded to wash his hands and
begin to get supper.</p>

<p>But we don’t propose to spend much time
with their supper or with the hunts that came
off during the week following. We have set
out to write about the Ghost Dance and the
various incidents connected with it, and so the
hunting will have to do for another story.
It will be enough to say that the party was
successful beyond its hopes; that one wagon
was loaded in two days and sent to the fort
under the command of a corporal, that they
killed more than one bear, and that the lieutenant
fairly shot himself into the good graces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">Page&nbsp;50</span>
of Carl, the Trailer. In fact his marksmanship
rather surprised himself, he had been so
long out of practice. He either shot his game
dead, or it did not run over fifty yards before
it was found. Carl began to treat the lieutenant
with more courtesy than he had previously
shown him.</p>

<p>But at length the week for which they had
come out drew to a close, and they began
making preparations to return to the fort.
When they were ready to start, Carl, who had
been behaving rather strangely of late, keeping
his Winchester with him all the while
and walking around the camp when he supposed
everyone else was asleep, drew up beside
Parker, who was riding in his usual place behind
the wagon.</p>

<p>“Have you seen any signs of Indians
lately?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nary sign,” replied Parker, “and I
looked closely, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw some,” replied the guide in a
quiet way which made the lieutenant open his
eyes. “I saw the print of an Indian’s foot by
the side of that stream that we were hunting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">Page&nbsp;51</span>
upon a few days ago, and I know that they
have been loafing around our camp ever
since.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell me of it?” asked
Parker with some heat.</p>

<p>“What good would it have done? You
were having a good time during our hunt,
and I did not want to say anything to take
away your pleasure. Besides, they were too
small a party to attack us, if they had any
such thought in mind, and were only watching
us to see where we went. It is my belief
that we shall see some more of them before
we reach the fort.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker was profoundly astonished.
The idea that his guide should see
Indian signs and say nothing to him about it
was something he had never dreamed of. It
was not treating him right as commander of
the expedition. He did not want to say anything
more to him, and Carl, as if guessing
the way his thoughts ran, relapsed into silence
and rode on without saying a word; but he
kept his eyes open, and carefully scanned the
top of every swell they passed. Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">Page&nbsp;52</span>
Parker did likewise, for somehow he could
not get over the thought that was uppermost
in the mind of the guide “that they would be
sure to see more of the Indians before they
reached the fort.” Sergeant Leeds was an old
soldier, and was constantly on the lookout for
suspicious signs; consequently he was not at
all alarmed when he discovered a solitary savage,
on the top of a neighboring hill, closely
watching all their movements. He took one
look at him, and then reined in his horse to
wait until his superior came up.</p>

<p>“There’s a Sioux up there, sir,” said he,
“and he seems to be more interested in our
movements than we are ourselves.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker had thus far ridden with
his hands in his pockets, but when he pulled
them out to take up the reins he found that
they trembled in spite of himself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V. <br />Reinforcements.</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Parker, accompanied
by his guide, rode up to the head of the
line, where he could get a good view of the
Indian. His face was very pale—he knew it
as well as if he had glanced into a mirror to
see it—and he looked at the savage through
his binoculars. He thought of Lieutenant
Kidder, who, with the thirteen men composing
his expedition, had been completely annihilated
by these same Indians, and wondered
if destiny had the same fate in store for himself.
The Indian was alone, but that was no
proof that his band might not be on the opposite
side of the swell, waiting to see what the
result of his investigation was going to be.
He was dressed in war costume. On his head
was a bonnet gaudily ornamented with feathers
which trailed and fluttered behind him, and
he held a gun of some description in his hands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">Page&nbsp;54</span>
As Parker looked at him he dismounted from
his horse, held his gun up so that the hunters
could see it, and laid it upon the ground.</p>

<p>“He is disarming himself,” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That is a sign that he wants to speak to
you,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to speak to him. If
he comes any nearer to us I shall send him
back.”</p>

<p>The expedition had not halted at all during
this time, but kept straight ahead, as though
the way was perfectly clear. Having disarmed
himself, the Indian mounted his horse and
rode down the hill to meet the hunters.</p>

<p>“There are Sioux on both our flanks,” said
the guide after a little pause.</p>

<p>“So there are,” said Lieutenant Parker,
casting a hasty glance on both sides of him.
“Keep your eyes open, Carl, and the first
move they make let me know it. That Indian
has come close enough.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant raised his hand and made a
signal to halt and go back, just as a boy who
is playing “I spy” does to a comrade whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">Page&nbsp;55</span>
interest it is to keep out of sight. The Indian
stopped and made other signs which Parker
did not understand; but the Indian understood
the signal to halt, however, and when it
was repeated with more energy than usual, he
turned his horse and rode back to the top of
the swell. Parker glanced at his men, and
was gratified to see that every one had put
away his pipe and held his carbine in readiness
for use. It certainly looked as though
there was going to be a fight. He thought
of all the instructions the colonel had given
him, and was ready to carry them out. His
voice was as steady as usual when he inquired
of his guide:</p>

<p>“What did that Indian mean when he made
those other signals?”</p>

<p>“He simply wanted to communicate—that
was all,” replied Carl.</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose would have
been the result if I had spoken to him?”
continued Parker.</p>

<p>“He would have come up and held some
conversation with you through an interpreter,
and in the meantime his band would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">Page&nbsp;56</span>
slipped over and been all ready to carry out
his programme, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“Then you really think he has got some
other Indians waiting for him on the other
side of the hill?” said Parker.</p>

<p>“Certainly I do. They would have come
over here one by one, so as not to arouse your
suspicions, and when there were enough of
them here to overpower us the chief would
have given his war-whoop, and in less than
two minutes we would all have been dead
men.”</p>

<p>“But some of them would have done their
last shooting,” said Parker, his eyes flashing
while he gripped his Winchester with a firmer
hold. “My soldiers were all ready.”</p>

<p>“Of course; that was to be expected. But
you don’t suppose that the loss of a few warriors
would whip his whole band?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did perfectly right in telling that
chief that I did not want to speak to him,”
said Parker, drawing a long breath of relief.
“Do you think he will pitch into us when we
get to the top of the hill?”</p>

<p>“No, for he could not choose a worse battleground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">Page&nbsp;57</span>
He will probably follow along behind
us for a few miles and then give it up.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker afterward said that he
never in his life felt such a tremor of fear as
he did when he mounted the swell on which
the Indian had stood half an hour before.
He expected that the appearance of his cap
above the hill would be the signal for a volley
of rifle-balls. His guide rode beside him all
the way, and as Parker looked at him he
wished he had some of that boy’s fearlessness.
He did not seem to care for the Indians at
all, and neither did his face change color.
He took off his sombrero, smoothed his long
hair down across his shoulders and out of
range of his eyes, all the while keeping his
gaze directed toward the hills on each flank,
to see that the savages did not make a rush
upon them. When they mounted to the top
of the swell not an Indian was to be seen,
either in front or on the flanks. They had
disappeared completely.</p>

<p>“Well, that squad of Sioux was easily
whipped,” said Parker; and only those who
have been in similar situations can realize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">Page&nbsp;58</span>
how great was his satisfaction. “I looked
for us to be laid out the minute we came in
sight.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a gully within half a mile of
here,” said Carl, “and this proves to be the
sort of fighting-ground that they don’t want.
They would surround us with a horde of
shrieking savages, all going at the top of their
speed, so that we would find it difficult to hit
one of them, and when they tired their horses
they would go into that gully and rest and
make up some other scheme for getting the
advantage of us. Then they would come out
and go at it again.”</p>

<p>“I declare there is some more of them over
there,” said Parker, whose eyes had been constantly
sweeping the horizon.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I am glad to see them.”</p>

<p>“Are they soldiers?” exclaimed Parker.</p>

<p>“They are, and the Indians caught sight
of them before we did. That is what drove
them away.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker breathed easy after that.
With his glass he could not make out the blue
uniforms because they were so far away, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">Page&nbsp;59</span>
he had faith in his guide’s word; and just
then Sergeant Leeds came up and saluted.</p>

<p>“The colonel was getting skeary on account
of us, sir,” said he, with a wink of his eye that
spoke volumes. “Them are soldiers who are
coming out to see what has become of us.”</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the approaching
cavalcade was near enough for the hunters to
see their uniforms, and Parker and his guide
galloped out to meet them. There were two
troops of them, and this proved that the colonel
knew something of the strength of the
band which he was afraid would meet them
on the way.</p>

<p>“Well, old boy, I am glad to see that you got
back safe,” said the captain in command, as he
leaned forward and extended his hand to Lieutenant
Parker. “Did you see any of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We saw one standing on the
top of that swell back there, and he made
signs that he wanted to speak to us; but I replied
that I did not want to speak to him, and
at the same time my guide discovered some
other Indians looking at us over the swells on
our flanks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">Page&nbsp;60</span></p>

<p>“You did well, sir; you did well. You
will make an Indian fighter one of these days.
Now let us see how much game you have.”</p>

<p>“Did that other expedition get through all
right, sir?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. They did not see any Sioux on
the way to bother them at all. You see, the
way we found out that they have an inclination
to go on the warpath at all was this:
Agent Galbraith sent a couple of men——Well,
I will give it up. They got more game
than we did, sergeant.”</p>

<p>While the captain was speaking he rode
around to the rear of the wagon, lifted the
canvas and looked under it. It was literally
filled with the animals that had fallen to the
hunters’ rifles; and when the officer reached
in and felt the plump quarters of an elk his
mouth watered.</p>

<p>“I must have a piece of that elk for my
supper,” said he.</p>

<p>“How about the Sioux getting on the warpath,
sir?” said Lieutenant Parker. He was
anxious to hear about that.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Lieutenant Hawkins, you take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">Page&nbsp;61</span>
command of the column and march them
back to the fort. I will ride behind with the
boys. You see, Agent Galbraith sent up a
couple of men to order the Sioux to stop their
Ghost Dance, and when the Sioux found that
they were coming they pointed their guns at
them and warned them to go back. That was
all the news we wanted. The next day they
sent a band of warriors to loaf about the fort,
and that is what scared the colonel. He was
sure they would find you out here and he sent
me to look you up.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it was very kind of him,” said
Parker. “Are all the Sioux engaged in this
Ghost Dance, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, there are probably twenty thousand
of them in all, and more than half of them
don’t take any stock in the Ghost Dance.
They can no doubt raise six hundred or a
thousand men, and we have three thousand to
oppose them. We are all around them, too.
I wish that old Sitting Bull was captured.”</p>

<p>During the ride to Fort Scott the captain,
who talked plainly and explained many things
about the Ghost Dance which the young officer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">Page&nbsp;62</span>
had failed to understand, finally convinced
him that his guide had told him nothing but
the truth. As American Horse, a brave chieftain
of the Sioux, once said while making a
speech before the Peace Commissioners:
“We were made many promises, but have
never heard from them since.” Take, for instance,
the issue of beef which was made at
the Standing Rock Agency. In one year it
amounted to eight million pounds; and in
three years more, after the whites had got all
the land the Indians wanted to sell, it was reduced
to four million pounds, or just half of
what they wanted. It was no wonder that
the Indians complained of starvation; and
when they asked permission to go off their
reservation to hunt for the food that was to
keep their families from giving way to the
appeals of hunger, they were refused.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame the Indians so much, after
all,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“And if you come right down to that,
neither do I,” whispered the captain. “The
Government will not give the Indians over to
the War Department, as many thinking men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">Page&nbsp;63</span>
advise them to do, and we have got to stand
by and see them suffer. And another thing:
you don’t know how those Indians behave
themselves when they take the bit in their
teeth and go off their reservation. I tell you,
you would remember all the broken promises
the whites have made you and go in strong for
revenge. Of course we soldiers can’t stand
by, with our hands in our pockets, and let
innocent people suffer because of what the
Department at Washington has done to them,
and we have to stand between the settlers and
Indian barbarities.”</p>

<p>“And the Sioux don’t think much of us
any way, do they, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not now they don’t, for they are as well
armed as we are. In olden times, when the
trappers roamed through this country, the
Indians were all armed with bows and arrows,
and it was very seldom you heard of a company
of men being annihilated. The trappers
had so little to steal that the Sioux did
not think it worth while to lose the lives of
three or four men in the effort to get it. The
trappers were dead shots, and they brought an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">Page&nbsp;64</span>
Indian every time they pulled on him. The
Indians would keep an eye on the trappers’
camps, and when there was no one there to
protect them they would sneak up and steal
everything they could lay their hands on.
But now the case is different. The savages
are armed with rifles and revolvers, and it has
to be a pretty strong force that can march
through their country.”</p>

<p>“You really think there is going to be a
war, do you, sir?”</p>

<p>“I do, unless we can go to work and arrest
that Sitting Bull, and that will take our whole
force. Those Sioux are not going to stand by
and see us capture their biggest medicine man
without some resistance.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker drew a long breath and
told himself that his prospects of seeing an
Indian fight were very good indeed.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI. <br />Dispatches.</h2>

<p>“By the way, Parker, I think the colonel
has some other business for you to
transact when you get back to the fort,” said
the captain, when they had ridden a little
while in silence. “Of course the colonel has
not said so, but I rather gained the idea from
something I heard the adjutant say to him.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to assume anything he thinks
I can do, sir,” said the lieutenant, who wondered
what this new business was going to be.
“I will even go to Standing Rock Agency.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose that is right where he
wants to send you with dispatches for General
Miles,” said the captain. “You will have
one guide with you, and as large an escort as
the colonel may think you need.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to undertake it,” said Parker,
“but I don’t intend to be captured.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” said the captain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">Page&nbsp;66</span>
“But the colonel does not expect that the
Sioux will attempt to capture you and hold
you as a prisoner. You will have to go right
by the place where they are holding their
Ghost Dance, and if the Indians discover you,
they will lose no time in keeping you until
their dance is over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good that will do, sir.
Don’t they want us to know anything about
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they don’t. The Sioux
have a theory that if anyone outside their
tribe witnesses the ceremony, that will make
the dance of no account, and it will all have
to be done over again.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker seemed to have grown
two inches when he heard this. He was going
to get a chance to make a hero of himself—that
is, if the colonel thought fit to send him
with the dispatches. He thought of what old
California Joe would have done in a case like
this. After Custer’s fight with Black Kettle,
in which a great victory was gained and the
power of the Cheyennes completely broken,
Joe was selected as a courier to carry the report
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">Page&nbsp;67</span>
to General Sheridan, whose headquarters
were at Camp Supply. The journey was only
about a hundred miles long, but it was
through a country that was thickly covered
with hostile Indians. General Custer offered
him an escort of fifty men, but to his surprise
Joe said he did not want anybody except
Jack Corbin, his partner. Custer told him to
go ahead, and these two men made the journey—two
hundred miles—in just forty-eight
hours, although they had several wide detours
to make in order to keep clear of the savages.
Lieutenant Parker did not know whether or
not he was experienced enough to try such a
plan as that, but he determined that he would
attempt it. Everything depended on getting
by the Sioux without being seen. If the Indians
discovered him he would certainly be
captured, and what would be done with him
after that he did not know. He would not
say anything to the captain about it, but if the
colonel asked him how large an escort he
wanted, he would take Carl, the Trailer, and
set off.</p>

<p>The captain was a talkative fellow, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">Page&nbsp;68</span>
during the twenty years of his life that he
had passed on the plains and among the wild
Indians he had gained a world of information,
and accumulated an almost inexhaustible
fund of stories which he was ready to tell for
the benefit of younger officers. He related
one after another of his anecdotes during the
march to the fort; and when at last the whitewashed
stockade came into full view and
Lieutenant Parker rode through the wide
gate, he saw that the teamsters and soldiers
stopped and raised their hats to him, a thing
they had never done before. Parker was
popular among the soldiers; for, although he
was very strict,—as much so as the colonel
himself,—and tried as hard to make his men
“toe the mark,” when off duty he was “hail-fellow
well met” with everybody. The captain
and Parker came out from behind the
wagon to see their men come into line in front
of the colonel’s headquarters, and then dismounted
and went in to report.</p>

<p>“I have returned, sir,” said the captain.
“I found the lieutenant coming along the
prairie all right. He had some experience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">Page&nbsp;69</span>
with the Sioux, but he came on ahead as
though there was nothing there.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said the colonel. “You
may dismiss your men.” Then, unbending a
little from his official dignity, he held out his
hand to Parker and smiled upon him over his
gold spectacles. “Well, my boy, I am glad
to see that you have returned all right.”</p>

<p>“I have returned, sir,” said Parker, not
forgetting that part of his duty, “and I have
a wagonful of game.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, go on and tell me something
about those Sioux you met. Were they a
large party?”</p>

<p>“I did not see all of them, sir; not more
than a dozen. The chief made signs that he
wanted to talk to me, but I sent him back. I
thought if he wanted to talk to anybody he
could come down here and talk to you. He
knew where your headquarters were as well
as I did.”</p>

<p>“There were a good many more than a
dozen men in that party,” said the colonel.
“That was the reason I sent the captain out
after you. Have you had sleep enough?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">Page&nbsp;70</span></p>
<p>“Yes, sir, all I want,” said Parker, who
now thought he was about to hear of the additional
business the colonel had for him to
do.</p>

<p>“Can you go without sleep to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and for forty-eight hours longer.”</p>

<p>“I guess somebody has been saying a little
to you about what I have on hand,” said the
colonel with a smile. “Well, I don’t know
as I blame the captain for that. How large
an escort of soldiers do you think you will
want to go with you to Standing Rock
Agency?”</p>

<p>“I want just one, sir.”</p>

<p>“One!” exclaimed the colonel, opening his
eyes. “Remember that you will have to cross
their lines somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I know it, sir; but it will be easier for
two men to hide than it will for a larger number.
If I were going to ask for a larger squad
than I have named, I should ask for your
whole force.”</p>

<p>The commanding officer settled back in his
chair and stared at the lieutenant without
speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">Page&nbsp;71</span></p>

<p>“I would like to have one man go with me,
sir, if I might be allowed a choice,” said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Carl, the Trailer.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have got on pretty good
terms with him during the last week,” said
the colonel, straightening up again. “Well,
come around in about half an hour and I will
talk to you. I want to add something to these
dispatches about the war-party of Sioux you
met while coming home. Bring Preston with
you. You may dismiss your men, and detail
two of them to cut up game enough for supper.
Perhaps you had better get something
to eat before you go.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker arose to his feet, made
his best salute, and went out. He seemed to
be treading on air. The colonel thought
enough of him to send him where he had
always sent a brave and experienced man, and
here he was scarcely six months out of West
Point. The captain was standing just outside
the door, with his hands on his hips, watching
his men, who were going toward the stables,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">Page&nbsp;72</span>
and hearing the lieutenant’s footsteps behind
him turned and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I tell you it pays to keep your weather-eye
open, sir,” said Parker, as he came up and
saluted.</p>

<p>“Have you got it?” demanded the captain,
who seemed as delighted as the lieutenant
himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir, but I have orders to
come around in half an hour and bring Carl,
the Trailer, with me.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going—you can bet on that.
Did you hear who else he is going to send
with you? I wonder if he will select me?”</p>

<p>“That is all I want, sir.”</p>

<p>“All! Carl, the Trailer!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, young man, you’re crazy!
You will never get through their lines in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be easier for
two men to hide than it would be for fifty,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to hide from them? Did
you tell that to the colonel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">Page&nbsp;73</span></p>

<p>“I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t go; you can bet your
bottom dollar on that. You don’t want to
hide from them,” continued the captain, seeing
that the lieutenant looked disappointed
over what had been said. “You want to go
by them openly and above-board, so as to let
them know that we are not afraid of them.
If they see that we know they are going on
with the dance, I think they will stop it. Be
careful in the future, when the colonel is talking
of sending you on an expedition, that you
don’t say anything about <em>hiding</em>. That’s a
word that won’t go down.”</p>

<p>“But look here, captain,” said Parker,
a bright idea striking him, “the colonel
suggested that I get something to eat before
I go.”</p>

<p>“W-h-e-w!” whistled the captain. “This
beats me. Here you are ordered to take dispatches
through a band of savages who have
never yet done the first thing to indicate that
they were on the warpath excepting to point
their guns at those two men that Galbraith
sent out to stop them in their Ghost Dance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">Page&nbsp;74</span>
and the colonel does not object to your hiding
from them! I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he does not want it to get out
among them that he has been sending dispatches
to General Miles,” suggested Parker.</p>

<p>“Oh, he needn’t think to stop it that way.
Mark my words,” said the captain, approaching
close to Parker and laying his forefinger
upon his shoulder, “the Sioux will know of
that dispatch as soon as Miles will. You
needn’t think to keep it from them.”</p>

<p>So saying the captain walked away, leaving
Parker lost in wonder. He glanced about the
parade ground, but he couldn’t see anything of
a Sioux brave there; and then, seeing his men
drawn up in line and waiting for him to dismiss
them, he beckoned Leeds to approach him.</p>

<p>“Break ranks,” said he, “and set two of
the men at work cutting up some of that game
for supper. Remember that the captain wants
some of that elk.”</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of his men, Lieutenant
Parker walked slowly toward the place
where Carl, the Trailer, was standing, waiting
to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">Page&nbsp;75</span></p>

<p>“Say, Carl,” he said, sinking his voice
almost to a whisper, “do you see any Sioux
Indians around here?”</p>

<p>“Nary one,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“I have been ordered to take some dispatches
to General Miles, and you are to go
with me to show me the way. You and I are
to go alone.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“I have been talking with the captain
about it, and he says that the Sioux will know
of that dispatch as soon as Miles will. Now,
it strikes me that there must be somebody here
to carry the news.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether he meant that or
not—I can’t say; but I have no fear of not getting
into the fort with dispatches. When we
come out and try to get home is where they
are going to catch us.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that is the place they will
watch for us?”</p>

<p>“It is always the place where I begin to
use caution,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“You are not afraid to attempt it?”</p>

<p>Carl, the Trailer, raised himself up to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">Page&nbsp;76</span>
full height and looked at the lieutenant. He
did not speak, and Parker did not press him
for an answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I should be afraid if I
were in your place,” continued the lieutenant.
“There are some people here who would not
be anyways sorry to hear of your death.”</p>

<p>“Let them come,” said Carl; and Parker
had never seen such an expression of rage
and contempt as overspread his features. “I
am ready for them.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who they are?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker waited to hear more. He
wanted to find out whether or not those people
who would in any way profit by the death of
the guide were relatives; but Carl had no
more to say. He stood with one arm thrown
over his saddle, and waited for Parker to send
him away about his business.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I suppose you are all right,”
said the lieutenant. “Go and get something
to eat, and be on hand in half an hour. It is
now four o’clock,” he added, glancing at his
watch. “We must see General Miles, get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">Page&nbsp;77</span>
his return dispatch, and be back here in forty-eight
hours. Do you suppose we can do it?”</p>

<p>“If you can keep up I’ll be on time,” said
the guide, leading his horse toward the gate.</p>

<p>“I really wish I had not said anything
about that,” said Parker, as he led his own
horse away toward the stables. “I’ve got him
down on me, and that is one thing I don’t
like.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII. <br />Going in.</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Parker had not much
time to waste if he expected to be before
the commanding officer in half an hour, and
he went about his work as if he was thoroughly
in earnest. He placed his horse in one of the
stalls, removed his saddle, gave him a good
feed at the same time, in order to “brace him
up” for his long journey, and then proceeded
to rub him down. All the while he was
thinking about his recent interview with Carl,
the Trailer, and promised himself that he
would steer clear of that subject in future.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that for you, sir,” said a voice near
him.</p>

<p>Parker looked up, and saw Sergeant Leeds
with his hand to his cap.</p>

<p>“I really wish you would,” said he, putting
the brush into the sergeant’s willing hand.
“I’ve got just half an hour to get my supper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">Page&nbsp;79</span>
and present myself before the colonel, and I
want the horse to go away with me to-night.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. The horse will be ready.”</p>

<p>Parker hurried off, and in a few minutes
was standing before the washbowl in his own
quarters. He wished to get a little of the
dust of travel off his hands and face, put on
a clean shirt, and make himself appear as neat
as an officer should who expected to have an interview
with his general before he slept again.
His room-mate had been on guard duty the
night before and was now making up for his
loss of sleep; but he heard Parker stepping
about the room, and opened his eyes and
stretched his arms.</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow, I am glad to see you
back,” said he. “Do you know I have been
worrying about you ever since yesterday morning?”</p>

<p>“About that war-party?” said Parker.</p>

<p>“They are the very fellows. They did not
come about the fort, but some of the scouts
discovered them and reported to the colonel.
That is what made him send the captain out
after you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">Page&nbsp;80</span></p>

<p>“Well, I got away from them all right. I
hope I shall be as lucky this time.”</p>

<p>“This time!” repeated Randolph. “Why,
where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Fort Yates.”</p>

<p>Randolph was utterly amazed to hear this.
He threw off the blanket and sat up on the
bed.</p>

<p>“The colonel wants to send a report to
General Miles, and is now adding a word
about this war-party I met,” continued Parker.
“I’ve got to be with him in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“You are going in command of a big
escort, of course,” said Randolph, angry at
himself because he was so long neglected.
“Perhaps I will get a chance to go with you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will this time. I am
only going to take Carl, the Trailer.”</p>

<p>“And no more?” said Randolph, who grew
more and more amazed.</p>

<p>“He is all I asked for, and I believe I am
going to get him.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you get ready to start come
in and let me bid you good-by,” said Lieutenant
Randolph, again stretching himself on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">Page&nbsp;81</span>
the bed. “I will never see you dressing in
this room again.”</p>

<p>“Our biggest scouts take no more with them
than that,” said Parker. “They want somebody
with them if they get into trouble, but
they don’t want a large party for fear that
they cannot conceal themselves.”</p>

<p>“Who is talking about concealing a party?”
asked Randolph in disgust. “You had better
not let the colonel know that.”</p>

<p>“He knows it already.”</p>

<p>“And did he agree to it?”</p>

<p>“He raised no objections to it, but told me
to come back in half an hour. I tell you I
had better go on, for twenty minutes of my
time is gone already. Good-by, Rand. I
hope I shall see you again within forty-eight
hours.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Randolph. He got
upon his feet and shook his companion’s hand
as though he never expected to see him again.
Then he opened his mouth as if he were about
to say something, but no sound came forth.
He turned and threw himself upon the bed
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">Page&nbsp;82</span></p>

<p>“I declare, I hope that everybody won’t
act that way,” said Lieutenant Parker, as,
with a face that had lost considerable of its
confidence, he took rapid steps toward his
mess-room. “The first thing I know I shall
begin to behave that way myself.”</p>

<p>When Parker entered the mess-room he
summoned the cook, and found that all that
was left for him was what remained of what
the officers had had for dinner. “If Lieutenant
Parker could only wait for a few minutes”—but
Lieutenant Parker could not wait
for even one minute. He had an order from
the commanding officer which must be fulfilled
to the letter; so the cook began to bestir himself,
and in a short time a very good meal was
placed before him. He ate with his watch
open beside him, so that he could cast his
eyes upon it with every mouthful he took, and
at precisely the time agreed upon he jumped
up and started for the door. As he stepped
down off the threshold, the first one he saw
was Carl, the Trailer. The savage scowl had
left his face and he looked just as he did during
their hunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">Page&nbsp;83</span></p>

<p>“You are on hand, I see,” said Lieutenant
Parker. “Come on; we have not a single
instant to lose.”</p>

<p>The young officer took his way toward the
colonel’s headquarters, and found him in the
act of sealing an envelope which he was going
to send to General Miles. He simply nodded
when the boys came in and then went on addressing
it; and when he had got that done
he settled back in his chair, struck a match to
his pipe, which had gone out, and looked at
them for several minutes without speaking.
Finally he said:</p>

<p>“Preston, are you sure that you want to go
to Fort Yates in company with Lieutenant
Parker?”</p>

<p>“Why, colonel, I don’t see anything wrong
about him,” said the guide. “We will get
the dispatches into the hands of the general
in due time, but how soon you will get the
letters he sends in return I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s just what I am afraid of,” said
the colonel uneasily. “You are afraid there
will be somebody there to watch you when
you come out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">Page&nbsp;84</span></p>

<p>Carl, the Trailer, said that that was what
he was afraid of.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as it makes much difference
to me what he sends in return,” said
the colonel, after gazing abstractedly at his
table for a few minutes. “He will have to
send them down by his own scouts. If you
can get into the fort, it is all I ask for. If
you are all ready you can go. I shall expect
you back here in three days.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker wanted to tell his colonel
that if he did not see them by that time day
after to-morrow he would not see them at all,
but he thought he would wait and let his actions
speak for him. Parker took the papers
which the colonel handed him and put them
into the pocket of his coat, which he buttoned
up; and after shaking him by the hand and
listening to his words of encouragement and
advice, the boys went out. There were many
around the gate to see them off, for Lieutenant
Parker had never gone on an errand like this
before, and when the boys mounted their
horses and rode out of the stables, caps were
lifted all around them. Randolph was there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">Page&nbsp;85</span>
for he could not stand idly by and let his
companion go off on that dangerous mission
without another word to him.</p>

<p>“Good-by, old fellow,” said he, pressing up
close to Parker, so that he could take his
hand. “Remember that I shall look for you
by day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I will be on hand,” exclaimed Parker,
with a sweeping salute to all the rest of them
who had gathered around. “If the horses
hold out I shall certainly be here.”</p>

<p>“That fellow acted as though he was not
going to see you any more,” said Carl, when
they had left the fort behind them. “I don’t
see the use of their making so much fuss
over our going. I have been to Standing
Rock Agency half a dozen times since this
trouble began, and have always got back
safe.”</p>

<p>“Well, it had no effect upon me except to
make me all the more determined to come
back,” said Parker. “The colonel said that
if we could get into the fort it was all he asked
for. Now, what does he mean by that?”</p>

<p>“It means that some things have happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">Page&nbsp;86</span>
that are going to put us in more danger than
we supposed,” said Carl. “To my mind there
is something up.”</p>

<p>“You think the dance has got farther along
than we know anything about?” said Parker.</p>

<p>“It must be that. The Sioux are determined
that no one shall cross their reservation.
But the first thing we have to do is to
get those papers you have in your pocket into
the hands of General Miles. We will wait
until we see how the matter looks then.”</p>

<p>This was a long time to wait. Lieutenant
Parker was anxious that something should be
done at once; but Carl kept his horse in a fast
walk all the way—sometimes, when he got
tired of that, letting him trot for a short distance,
and Parker was obliged to keep pace
with him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in too big a hurry,” said the
guide, who saw that Lieutenant Parker was
slyly pricking his horse with the spur to
make him go faster. “Let them go easy now,
and save their speed for by and by.”</p>

<p>The guide relapsed into silence, but at the
same time his eyes were busy. He kept a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">Page&nbsp;87</span>
close watch over the summit of the neighboring
swells to make sure that they had not
been seen by some of Sitting Bull’s couriers,
who were on the lookout for them to find out
where they went. As soon as they found out
that the guide and his companion were headed
toward Fort Yates they would get ahead of
them, and so post the Sioux in regard to their
coming. Grand River, which lay immediately
across their path, was the permanent
camp of the Sioux. Beginning on the right,
at the mouth of the river, there was Antelope’s
camp, Grand River school, Sitting Bull’s
camp, Bull Head’s camp, Pretty Bird’s camp,
and Spotted Horse’s camp; and by going
farther up the river there was Thunder
Hawk’s camp. It did not seem possible that
they could get through there without being
seen by somebody. And these camps extended
for seventy-five miles along the course
of the river. Of course Lieutenant Parker
did not know this, but the guide did; and,
while he kept his gaze wandering over the
tops of the hills, he was thinking up some
plan by which he might cross the river, get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">Page&nbsp;88</span>
through their lines, and take the trail of fifty
miles to the fort. The Grand River school
seemed to him to be the best place.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew just what is going on in
that camp,” said he, after thinking the matter
all over. “Kicking Bull has come up here
from the Cheyenne reservation to teach Sitting
Bull’s followers the dance, and I would really
like to know if he is at it to-night. If he is,
we can get across the river anywhere; but if
he is not engaged in teaching them, the different
camps will be full of Indians, and we shall
be seen as surely as we come out of the water.
Don’t you wish you had stayed at home?”</p>

<p>“That is a pretty question for you to
ask,” returned Lieutenant Parker indignantly.
“Somebody has got to do it, and I don’t see
why I can’t.”</p>

<p>The guide relapsed into silence again, and
for long hours neither of them said a word.
Nothing was heard except the faint swishing
of the buffalo grass as the horses brushed it
aside with their legs, and the faint tread of
the animals’ feet upon the sand. Finally
the guide allowed his horse to gallop, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">Page&nbsp;89</span>
that was a great relief to Lieutenant Parker’s
feelings. And one thing which surprised
Parker was the ease with which Carl’s horse
kept up. No matter how fast he went he was
always within Parker’s reach. Thus walking
and galloping by turns, the hours passed away
much sooner than Parker had thought possible,
and finally, to his immense satisfaction,
the guide pulled up his horse and began to
look about him.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a school-house over
there,” said he.</p>

<p>“Why, are we at the river?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“It is only about twenty feet ahead of you.
Do you hear any yells anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but the coyotes.”</p>

<p>The guide listened a moment, and then
turned his horse and rode down the stream,
Lieutenant Parker keeping close at his heels.
Presently he turned again and rode down the
bank, and then there was the splashing of
water beneath his horse’s hoofs. The ford
was a shallow one, and how Carl had struck it
in that darkness was a marvel. It continued
for perhaps five minutes, and then Parker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">Page&nbsp;90</span>
felt himself mounting the opposite bank. He
stopped his horse when his guide did and
listened intently, but he heard no sound of
any kind.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, you may go as fast as you
please,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“How far is the fort from here?”</p>

<p>“About fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“But the Sioux will hear us.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t. They are off somewhere
attending that Ghost Dance.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker waited to hear no more.
If his guide thought it safe to go with the full
speed of their horses it was nothing to him.
He drew up on the reins, touched his horse
with his spurs, and went away like the wind.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">Page&nbsp;91</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII. <br />Coming Out.</h2>

<p>This was the first race that Lieutenant
Parker and Carl, the Trailer, had ever
engaged in, and if there had not been so much
at stake they would have thoroughly enjoyed
it. For miles they kept going at the top of
their speed, and then, to Parker’s amazement,
his horse fell behind and required constant
spurring to make him keep up. After they
had gone half the distance to the fort, Parker
reluctantly drew rein and gave up the contest.</p>

<p>“That is one thing at which you can beat
me,” said he. “I had no idea that that nag
of yours could show so much lightness of foot.”</p>

<p>“It is always so when a fellow brings out
Eastern horses to beat them,” said the guide.
“You take a race of five miles, and the Eastern
horse will beat; but you take a race of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">Page&nbsp;92</span>
twenty miles, and it is safe to back the endurance
of the pony.”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t stand much of a show
with the Sioux in a fair trial of speed,” said
Parker.</p>

<p>“Not if you had any distance to go. More
than one fellow has been hauled off his Eastern
horse and killed within sight of his
friends. I remember hearing some trappers
talk about it at the time of the Custer massacre.
One fellow, who had a nice horse,
happened to get away from the hostiles, and
took out across the plains at the top of his
speed, followed by six or seven of the savages.
The Indians were going to give up after a
while, but all of a sudden they saw the officer
pull out a pistol and put it to his own head.
You see, he knew what his fate would be if
captured. That is the only time I ever heard
of an Eastern horse beating a pony.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker was not very well
pleased with such talk as this. It reminded
him too much of what might be his own case
if he ever got into a race with the Indians.
Lieutenant Kidder and band, who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">Page&nbsp;93</span>
overtaken and annihilated by some of the
same Indians among whom he was going, had
tried on American horses to escape the death
they saw threatening them, but after a race of
fifteen miles the ponies came up, and it was
all over with them. He did not ask any more
questions after that until his guide pointed
out something on the top of a distant swell.
He looked, and there were the walls of the
fort in plain sight; and scarcely had this
thought passed through his mind when he
heard a voice directly in front of him saying:</p>

<p>“Halt! Who comes there?”</p>

<p>“An officer without the countersign,” replied
Parker.</p>

<p>“Halt, officer. Dismount. Corporal of
the guard!—Number 6.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker and his guide dismounted,
and in a few minutes the corporal
came up, bringing a lantern to assist him in
making out who the visitors were.</p>

<p>“I have been sent here with dispatches for
General Miles,” said the young officer. “I
am Lieutenant Parker, and this man is my
guide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">Page&nbsp;94</span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess you are all right, so you can
come on,” said the corporal. “How did you
get through the Sioux lines, sir?”</p>

<p>“We did not have any trouble with the
Sioux at all,” said Parker. “I guess that
Kicking Bull is holding a Ghost Dance somewhere,
is he not? We listened, but we heard
no yelling.”</p>

<p>“That’s where he is now, sir; but the agent
sent to him to give up the man, and old Bull
told him that he was going to send him home.
But what’s the use of that, sir? The Indians
will learn all they want to know in that time,
and they can go on with the dance without his
help.”</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Parker followed the corporal
through the gate, which stood wide
open, he kept his eyes on the watch for some
of those wily Sioux braves who were there to
apprise Sitting Bull of their coming, but he
saw none. In fact he had not seen a Sioux
Indian since he left Fort Scott. He began to
breathe a good deal easier.</p>

<p>“I believe we can go out as we came in,”
said he in a low voice to his guide. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">Page&nbsp;95</span>
Indians are all away learning the Ghost
Dance, and there is not one of them here to
carry the news to headquarters.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is so, but I am afraid it isn’t,”
said Carl. “Some brave, somewhere, has
seen us come in here, and when we are ready
to go out he will have help enough to stop us.”</p>

<p>Parker sent in his name by the orderly who
stood in front of the general’s door, who in a
few moments came out, again, with an invitation
to the lieutenant to step inside. Parker
obeyed, and presently found himself in
the company of an elderly gentleman who had
evidently just got up out of a warm bed, for
his hair was all rumpled up, and he had
thrown on a dressing-gown which enveloped
him from his head to his heels.</p>

<p>“I believe I have seen you before, Lieutenant
Parker,” said the general, taking the
papers which were handed him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; that was when you ordered me
to report to Colonel Dodge of the —th Cavalry.”</p>

<p>“Well, you found it a good place, didn’t
you?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">Page&nbsp;96</span></p>
<p>“Yes, sir. That is, it is well enough now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by <em>now</em>?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sir, that the colonel has got so
that he can trust me, and he sends me out on
little expeditions—like this one, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the general with a smile.
“Well, you live up to your full duty while
you are in garrison and I will answer for it
that you will see plenty of service of this
kind.”</p>

<p>The general then opened the dispatches, and
when he had got a page half read he noticed
that Parker was still standing, with his hat in
his hand, and he told him to sit down, at the
same time offering a slight apology for his
neglect. The lieutenant thanked him and
took a chair, running his eye over the articles
of furniture with which the general had
thought it necessary to surround himself, and
he made up his mind that the officer was not
as fond of hunting as his colonel was. There
were no weapons to be seen, and not a stuffed
head of antelope or buffalo did he see to remind
him of the plains.</p>

<p>“Now, lieutenant, I shall want you to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">Page&nbsp;97</span>
my answer in your colonel’s hands as soon as
possible,” said the general. “Do you want
some refreshments—you or your men?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We brought in our pockets a
bite to eat. I have but one man with me.”</p>

<p>The general did not say anything more.
He did not express surprise that Parker had
come away from the fort with only a guide,
for he evidently thought that was the way to
do. He wrote rapidly for fifteen minutes, and
when the dispatch was completed he handed
it to the young officer and said: “There you
are, sir. Good luck to you,” and his interview
with the general was completed.</p>

<p>“He is a man after my own heart,” said
Parker, when he came up to the place where
the guide was standing, holding the horses.
“There is the officer of the day at the gate.
Let us ask him to pass us out.”</p>

<p>This was easily done, and the boys mounted
their horses and turned their faces homeward.
It was now broad daylight, and Lieutenant
Parker wondered how they were going to slip
by the Indians unperceived. It depended
upon where the Indians were. If they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">Page&nbsp;98</span>
still interested in their Ghost Dance, they
could cross the river without being seen by
anybody; but if they were done with it and
were at home, they would be discovered and
stopped. He thought at first that he would
see what Carl thought about it; but on looking
toward him he found that he was engaged
in filling up his pipe, and was going to indulge
in a smoke.</p>

<p>“I believe I will not say anything to him
about it,” said Parker. “When he is ready
to tell me, well and good; but I don’t care to
let him see how ignorant I am.”</p>

<p>And the guide did not get ready to broach
the subject until they had passed over the
fifty miles that lay between them and the
river, and were drawing near to the school-house.
It was a barren-looking place, with
no flowers or shade-trees around it, and it was
not such a spot as would have been chosen for
a place of learning in a civilized country.
There was no school in session now, for, their
parents being deeply interested in the Ghost
Dance, the children could not be expected to
learn anything; and, furthermore, they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">Page&nbsp;99</span>
to go to the new camp with their elders. As
Parker looked at the house he was certain that
he saw a head thrust carefully around it and
then as quickly withdrawn. He glanced at
his guide and was satisfied that he had seen
it, too, but his face never changed color.</p>

<p>“It is all up with us,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked
Parker; and although he intended that his
voice should be firm, it trembled a little in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>“It means that we are captured; at least I
am, but you can go where you please,” said
the guide.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Let us fight!” exclaimed
the lieutenant; and in an instant he had
thrown his Winchester up to his shoulder and
held it in position.</p>

<p>“Put up your gun,” said Carl sternly. “If
there is one Indian there, there are a dozen.
Besides, the report of your rifle would bring
the whole camp on us. Every one of those
tepees out yonder has two or three Indians in
it, sleeping soundly.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">Page&nbsp;100</span></p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you seen the women looking
out once in a while? Of course they know
that we are coming, and depend on those fellows
behind the school-house to capture us.
Now, when I am gone——”</p>

<p>Carl was about to go on and give his companion
some minute instructions as to the
course he must pursue in order to reach the
fort, but just then, as they went rapidly along
the road which ran close by the side of the
school-house, half a dozen Indians, painted
in all manner of grotesque shapes, suddenly
sprang up from their place of concealment
and made a wild dash for the guide’s horse.
One seized his horse by the bridle, and another
took hold of his gun, which was slung over
his shoulder by a broad strap, and with a
knife cut it loose from him. No attention
was paid to Parker, who sat on his horse and
wondered if the savages in a fight moved as
quickly as these did.</p>

<p>“White soldier, you go on,” said one who
seemed to be the leader of the assaulting
party. “We want nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker turned and looked closely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">Page&nbsp;101</span>
at the speaker. The voice did not sound as
though it came from an Indian, and when he
had taken a second glance at him, Parker saw
his white skin through the places where he
had not been touched up by the paint. He
was a squawman beyond doubt, and the lieutenant
wondered what Carl had been doing to
him to incur his enmity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the guide, “you go on to the
fort; I will have to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Why, how in the world am I to find my
way back there unless you go with me?” inquired
Parker, who was amazed at the proposition.</p>

<p>“You can see the sun, can’t you? Well,
just keep it to your right and go ahead.
Trust a little to your horse. He has been
that way once, and he can follow his old trail
back. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the squawman. “You
have wasted time enough here already.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to the threat implied by
these words, two of the Indians raised their
guns and pointed them at his head, and
Parker, taking the hint, urged his horse forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">Page&nbsp;102
</span>and began crossing the river. When he
reached the opposite side he turned to look at
Carl, and found that he and his captors were
just disappearing behind the water oaks which
lined the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>“Carl knew what he was talking about
when he said that some brave, somewhere, had
seen us go into the fort,” thought the lieutenant,
who was very much depressed by what
had occurred. “But it beats me how he got
into trouble with that squawman. Carl never
associated with such fellows as those. They
have got him, and now the next thing is to
find out what they are going to do with him.
I must see the colonel about it as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>Parker’s first care was to sling his Winchester
over his shoulder, and his second to put
his hands into his pockets. He remembered
how he had drawn that rifle to his face and
pointed it at an imaginary Indian who would
attempt to rush upon him, and here he had
gone and surrendered to half a dozen savages
who took his guide away from him. He was
fairly disgusted with himself when he thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">Page&nbsp;103</span>
of it. Why did he not make a fight, as he
had wanted to do?</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is just as well for me that I
didn’t,” said Parker to himself. “There must
have been five hundred Indians in that camp,
if they were all in their tepees, and of course
I couldn’t hold my own with them. If I ever
reach the fort, which is extremely doubtful,
Randolph will make no end of fun of me.”</p>

<p>By casting his eyes a little in advance of
him Parker could see that his horse was following
the old trail that he had made some
hours before. He could easily tell it, for there
were two trails, the grass all pressed down and
leaning in the opposite direction, and it had
been made while the dew was on. He came
along there in the night, but how would it be
when they reached the trail over which they
had passed in the daytime? He could only
wait and see.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX. <br />Still in the Saddle.</h2>

<p>The long ride which followed was something
that Lieut. Parker often thought
of with a shudder. It is true that there were
no wild animals to bother him—nothing but
the coyotes, which gathered around him and
kept pace with him almost to the fort; but
the thought that he was alone on the plains
and the uncertainty of what the Sioux intended
to do with his guide troubled him more than
anything else. As darkness came on apace,
and the wolves began to howl all about him,
Parker drew rein on the opposite bank of a
small stream and allowed his horse to graze
and recover his “second wind,” for he had
been riding rather rapidly of late, being anxious
to get over as much of the trail as he
could before the gloom came to shut it out
from his view, and now he began to think of
that envelope he had in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">Page&nbsp;105</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it lucky that the squawman did not
say anything to me about that dispatch?”
said the lieutenant to himself. “Suppose he
had asked me to give it up to him? Would I
have done it? I guess not. Nobody sees the
inside of that envelope unless he takes it off
my dead body.”</p>

<p>After passing half an hour in this way,
Parker watered his horse and again set out for
the fort. The animal went along as lively as
ever, and during the whole of that night
Parker rode with his hands in his pockets,
and never touched the reins at all. The way
seemed to have no end; but just as he was
forgetting his troubles and his head began to
bend forward, as if he were almost asleep, his
horse broke into a gallop and began to neigh.
Almost at the same instant a voice close in
front challenged him.</p>

<p>“I declare, I am pretty close to the fort,”
said Parker; and it was all he could do to
keep from yelling. “An officer without the
countersign,” he said, in reply to the sentinel.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was so anxious to see the colonel,
and tell him of what had happened back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">Page&nbsp;106</span>
there in the Sioux camp, that it seemed as
though the corporal never would come; but
he made his appearance at last, and the first
thing he did was to recognize his own officer.</p>

<p>“Why, lieutenant, I am glad to see you
again, sir,” said he, extending his hand, “but
I don’t see Carl, the Trailer, with you.”</p>

<p>“He stopped back there in the Sioux camp,”
said Parker. “I tell you I am tired,” he
added, seeing that the corporal opened his
eyes and was about to speak. “I want to get
to bed as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The colonel got up from a sound sleep to
read the dispatches, and the young officer
stood by, whirling his hat in his hand and
waiting impatiently until he got through;
and when the colonel looked up and was about
to tell him to go to his quarters, for he had
done with him for the night, he noticed that
Parker looked very solemn.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” he asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Matter enough, sir,” replied the lieutenant.
“I have lost my guide and you have lost a
scout.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">Page&nbsp;107</span></p>

<p>Without waiting for an invitation, Parker
went on and told his companion what had
happened at the Grand River school. The
colonel looked grave, and settled back in his
chair as though he did not know what to make
of it.</p>

<p>“And you came on alone?” he said, when
Parker finished his story.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but my horse picked out the way.
When it grew dark I could not see my hand
before me.”</p>

<p>“Well, go to your quarters now, and get all
the sleep you want. We will talk the matter
over again in the morning.”</p>

<p>“That is a pretty way to treat a man who
is in danger of his life,” said Parker to himself
as he went out to put up his horse. “If
I had been dead it would have been the same
thing.”</p>

<p>Of course there was great excitement among
the officers and men of the garrison when it
became known that Carl, the Trailer, had
been captured by the Sioux in broad daylight
and Lieutenant Parker left to find his way to
the fort alone. They did not know which to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">Page&nbsp;108</span>
wonder at the most—Parker’s knowledge of
“plainscraft,” or the audacity of the Indians
in making a capture almost within reach of
the fort, and when they were not on the warpath.
And then there was the squawman.
It was a great marvel to the officers how Carl
became acquainted with a person so low down
in the world, but the colonel thought he knew.
He sent for the lieutenant immediately after
breakfast and asked him to go over his story
again. This time all the ranking officers of
the garrison were present in his room.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you saw but one squawman
in the party that assaulted you?” asked
the colonel, after Parker had gone over his
adventure for the second time.</p>

<p>“I saw but the one, sir,” said Parker, “and
I wouldn’t have known what he was if it had
not been for his voice.”</p>

<p>“I will wager that there were two of them
there,” said the commanding officer. “You
see,” he added, turning to his officers, “there
used to be two hard characters in this country
who were named Harding and Ainsworth,
and they hired out to Carl’s father to herd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">Page&nbsp;109</span>
cattle for him. They understood their business,
but Mr. Preston thought that it would
be well worth while to watch them. One
night he detected them robbing him, and he
shot both of them; but they made out to get
away in spite of their wounds. One would
think that they would go as far from this
country as they possibly could, but it seems
that they had friends among the Sioux, and
right there was where they went. They sent
word to Preston where they were, adding that
they were waiting an opportunity to take
revenge upon him. They said they were
waiting for a chance to wipe out the entire
family.”</p>

<p>“But do you suppose that is the only thing
they have in mind, sir?” asked the major.
“Don’t you imagine that there is somebody
who is going to step in and enjoy the property
that Carl may leave behind him?”</p>

<p>“I have heard that hinted, too, but somehow
I can’t believe it,” said the colonel. “Mr.
Preston died a natural death, and if they
make away with Carl, they will do away with
the last one of the family. I do wish I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">Page&nbsp;110</span>
get my hands on those men,” added the officer,
rising to his feet and walking back and forth
in the room. “It does not make any difference
where a man goes, he is bound to make
some enemies if he is so fortunate as to fall
into property. In the States they are jealous
of him, and out here they want to kill him.
If Carl was a poor man those squawmen would
not take the least notice of him.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the colonel blamed himself
for allowing Carl, the Trailer, to go off to
Standing Rock Agency with Lieutenant Parker;
but Carl had been off there a dozen times
and came back safe, and he supposed he could
keep on doing it. After taking a few turns
up and down the floor he announced that he
couldn’t see any way out of it, and that all
they could do would be to stay there in the
fort and wait to see what was going to happen
to Carl.</p>

<p>“I would like to take a few of my men and
go up there and release him,” said he, once
more seating himself in his chair, “for somehow
I am as much interested in that boy as
though he were my own. But you see I can’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">Page&nbsp;111</span>
stir without orders. If I go up there it will
bring on a fight, sure.”</p>

<p>The colonel rested his elbows upon his
knees, gazed fixedly at the floor for a few
minutes, and then raised his eyes and fastened
them upon Lieutenant Parker.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what I might do,” said he.
“I could make out a report to General Miles,
and request that he make a demand on the
Sioux for Carl, the Trailer. In that way I
can get him.”</p>

<p>The officers all drew a long breath of relief,
for they were thinking about that very thing
themselves.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Parker? Can you
make that trip to Standing Rock Agency and
back without a guide?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the lieutenant promptly.
“I will start this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I won’t ask you to do it so soon as that,”
said the colonel with a smile. “I will relieve
you of all duty to-day, and to-morrow you
and your horse will be rested up and fit to
make the journey. Come to me to-morrow
afternoon at four o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">Page&nbsp;112</span></p>

<p>The colonel arose, and the officers took up
their hats and bowed themselves out. They
all laughed as they extended their hands to
Parker.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind being in your place myself,”
said the major. “You are going to
get up a reputation as a scout. You won’t
have any use for Carl when he gets back.”</p>

<p>“I will be glad to take that report to General
Miles, because I want to do something
for Carl,” said Parker. “He got into trouble
through me, and I want to get him out.”</p>

<p>After exchanging a few words with each of
the officers, Parker went into his own quarters,
where he found his room-mate waiting
for him. He had not been summoned into
the colonel’s presence with his comrades, but
he knew he would hear the full report when
the lieutenant came out.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Randolph, as Parker drew
off his shoes and stretched himself out on his
bed.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Parker, “it is going to be
just as the major says. I am going to get
up a reputation as a scout. I am ordered to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">Page&nbsp;113</span>
report to the colonel to-morrow afternoon at
four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Randolph.</p>

<p>“To Fort Yates.”</p>

<p>“Who are you going to take as your
guide?”</p>

<p>“I am going alone,” said the lieutenant
proudly.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall not bid you good-by as I
did the last time you went, for like as not you
will come back all right.”</p>

<p>“I hope to, certainly,” said Parker with a
smile. “The Sioux will not bother me.
That squawman told me so.”</p>

<p>“I would not place too much dependence
on that squawman,” said Randolph. “If it
suits him to lie about it, he is going to do it.”</p>

<p>“I shall go right ahead as though there
were no Sioux there. That is the way that
Carl did.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker did not sleep much that
day, for he was too busy thinking about what
the future might have in store for him. After
rolling and tossing on his bed for an hour, he
went out to see about his horse. The animal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">Page&nbsp;114</span>
was his main dependence now. If he missed
the trail and wandered away on the plains, he
might never find the fort. The horse was
hitched out in the middle of the stable, and
Sergeant Leeds, his coat off and sleeves rolled
up, was busily engaged in cleaning him off.</p>

<p>“I thought you would not object, sir, seeing
that the beast’s feet and legs were covered
with dust,” said he.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you,” said the lieutenant.
“I came out to do that myself. He
has got to take me to Fort Yates to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Will you take your company with you,
sir? I could really enjoy a ride of two hundred
miles.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I can’t take anybody. I
shall go alone.”</p>

<p>“Alone, sir? Why, there is every chance
in the world for you to get lost.”</p>

<p>“I came from Grand River alone after
dark,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a heap more than I could do.
The horse will be ready when you want him.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Leeds continued his work with a
despondent look on his face, and Parker went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">Page&nbsp;115</span>
out, feeling in all his pockets for a piece of
loose change. But the paymaster was not
due yet, and, like all young officers, the lieutenant
had managed to get rid of his money
over the sutler’s counter.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you I don’t spend my next quarter’s
salary with him,” muttered Parker, as he once
more turned his steps toward his room. “The
very time I need money I have not got it.”</p>

<p>The day wore away at last, however, and at
precisely half-past four o’clock the lieutenant
walked his horse up in front of the colonel’s
quarters, and leaving Sergeant Leeds to hold
him, he went in and reported that he was ready.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel exactly right in sending you
off in this way,” said the colonel, “but you
are the only one who knows the route. You
are sure you won’t get lost?”</p>

<p>“Not if my horse knows the way.”</p>

<p>“Well, there you are. Go on, and be back
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant took the envelope, put it into
his pocket, made a salute, and went out. He
shook hands with Sergeant Leeds, mounted
his horse, and rode out of the parade-ground.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X. <br />The Squawman’s Proposition.</h2>

<p>Carl, the Trailer, was sadly depressed
when he saw Lieutenant Parker ride
his horse into Grand River—not so much on
his own account, but he was thinking of the
dispatches which the latter carried in his
pocket. Although he spoke encouragingly
to him, he did not expect that the young
officer would find his way through to the fort
alone. The chances were that the horse would
fail to follow his own trail, and perhaps take
his rider a hundred miles out of his way.
But these thoughts had barely passed through
his mind when he was recalled to himself by
the actions of the squawman. The latter
took possession of the revolver which Carl
carried in his hip pocket, and then seized him
by the arm and pulled him to the ground.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so rough, if you please,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">Page&nbsp;117</span>
Carl indignantly. “I could have got down
without any of your help.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you could, but you see I wanted
to help you down,” replied the squawman
with a grin. “You have stayed in this country
just to see how this fight was coming out
between your people and the Sioux, and you
have stayed a little too long.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is going to be a
fight?” said Carl. He listened for the squawman’s
reply, and he believed every word he
said. Of course he was going to seek a chance
to escape before long, and he wanted to take
back with him some news for the colonel.</p>

<p>“A fight? Well, I should say so,” said
the squawman angrily. “Before it is over
you and all the rest of the white people will
be food for the wolves.”</p>

<p>“You believe in the Ghost Dance, then?
Don’t pull me so hard; I can keep up with
you.”</p>

<p>“Of course I believe in it, and so does every
man who has seen it. If I didn’t believe in
it, here’s something that would set me all
right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">Page&nbsp;118</span></p>

<p>He bared his brawny arm up to the shoulder
when he said this, and showed Carl the
scar made by a bullet which had come very
near ending his life.</p>

<p>“You see that, don’t you?” said the
squawman, fairly hissing the words through
his teeth.</p>

<p>“Of course I see it. But you had no business
to be caught robbing my father. I did
not do it.”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t; but I have got you
now, and I intend to make use of you, too.
Go in here.”</p>

<p>The squawman paused in front of a tepee
whose flap was wide open. Carl entered and
found himself on the inside of an Indian
house, and, although he had been in similar
situations before, he did not see how any Indian
tepee could be as dirty as this one was.
The beds were scattered all over, for the Indian
women had not yet found the time to
gather them up, and on one of them lay half
a dozen children fast asleep. Without an invitation
he sat down on one of the beds and
waited to see what the squawman was going to
do next. That worthy seemed to be in excellent
spirits, and it was not long before the
secret came out.</p>

<p>“Those women you saw outside don’t all
belong to me,” said he, as he took his pipe
from his pocket. “One of them is my wife,
and the others belong to my partners, Ainsworth
and Tuttle, whom your worthy general
has got in limbo. You heard about our holding
up that stage, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard all about it. Some of you
fellows shot the driver because he would not
stop for you, and you stand a pretty good
chance of having your necks stretched.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was afraid of,” said the
squawman. “But you must not allow that to
be done.”</p>

<p>“I?” exclaimed Carl. “I can’t help you
any.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can. When the war was here—and
I know about it, for I was on the Confederate
side—they used to exchange prisoners,
didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“I believe they did.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, ever since those two fellows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">Page&nbsp;120</span>
were caught I laid out to capture you the first
time you crossed the reservation, and get you
to write a letter to General Miles, telling him
that if he would let those men go I would let
you go. But first there has got to be some
little business between us.”</p>

<p>Carl leaned his head upon his hands, looked
reflectively at the ground, and thought about
it. What he had heard went a great way to
convince him that his circumstances were not
as bad as he thought they were. The squawmen
had sent these threatening messages to
his father during his lifetime, and he supposed
that when he was captured there was nothing
but death awaited him; but, somehow, General
Miles had managed to capture two of the
men who were given to holding up stagecoaches,
and that had put a different view on
the matter. This squawman—Harding, his
name was—came to the conclusion that he had
better go easy with Carl. He would offer to
exchange him—one scout for two prisoners—and
then he would be all right. He could
afterward capture Carl, and do what he
pleased with him. The scout saw through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">Page&nbsp;121</span>
his scheme as easily as the squawman did;
and, furthermore, he was anxious to help it
along. Very cautiously he let his hands drop
until they rested on his breast. There was
one thing upon which Carl congratulated himself
at the time of his capture, and that was
that the squawman did not attempt to search
his clothes in the hope of finding more weapons.
He thought that the rifle and single
revolver were all he had; but stowed away in
the inside pockets of his moleskin jacket were
two revolvers which he thought might come
handy in time. He could feel them now, as
he allowed his hands to drop.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you thinking of?” asked
Harding, as he lighted his pipe and sat down
on a bed opposite to the one Carl occupied.
“You can write, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can write, but I don’t know
that it will do any good,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“I will bet you can put it down to him so
that it <em>will</em> do some good,” said the squawman
with a hideous smile. “Suppose you tell him
that the only scout he has got at Fort Scott
stands a fair chance of being tied up to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">Page&nbsp;122</span>
stake if he don’t release my partners. What
then?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can tell him all that, but you
can make up your mind to be hanged if you
are ever captured,” said Carl. “Is there anybody
here who can read writing?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there are three fellows here who
used to go to school at Carlisle,” said the
squawman. “You see, after you have written
the letter I will take it to them to see if
you have read it to me right, and if you have
I will send it off.”</p>

<p>“It is lucky I spoke to you about that,”
said Carl to himself. “I’ll write such a letter
as I am willing those Carlisle fellows should
read. Do they, too, believe in the Ghost
Dance?” he added aloud.</p>

<p>“I tell you that everybody believes in it
who has seen it,” returned the squawman.
“Everything goes to prove that it is a part of
the religion that the white folks have got up
for themselves.”</p>

<p>“In what way does it prove it?” asked the
scout. He had a chance now to learn something
about the Ghost Dance. He was more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">Page&nbsp;123</span>
interested in it than he was in effecting his
escape.</p>

<p>“Why, this earth is going to be destroyed,”
said Harding. “It is all worn out now, the
buffalo and all the other game is gone up, and
we are going to have it new, as it was before
the white folks came here and spoiled it all
for us. Those who don’t believe in the Ghost
Dance will all be killed by a fire or an earthquake
or something, and those who believe
enough in it to wear their ghost shirts will be
saved.”</p>

<p>“What is that about the ghost shirts?” said
Carl; for you must remember that what this
squawman said was all news to him.</p>

<p>“Hold on and I will show you one,” said
Harding. “You must say nothing to nobody
about it, for if you do, the shirt will not be
of any use to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will say nothing about it,” said the
scout with a laugh. “I shall not get a chance.
If the general will not exchange those two
prisoners for me, I shall be in a bad fix.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you, though?” said the squawman
with a grin. “You will be gone up, sure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">Page&nbsp;124</span>
However, it will give you a little chance for
your life.”</p>

<p>“You bet it will,” said Carl mentally.
“While you are waiting for your letter from
General Miles, I will be looking out for an
opportunity to escape.”</p>

<p>The squawman went to one side of the
tepee, and after removing the iron kettle which
contained what was left of the breakfast and
kicking aside a few old pots and pans, he
finally drew out a buffalo bag that contained
one thing that he prized above everything else
upon earth. In a few minutes he drew out the
ghost shirt, and held it up so that Carl could
have a fair view of it. The garment was made
of a light buckskin, sewed with deer sinew,
and cut in the form of all the Indians’ hunting-shirts.
The outside of it was ornamented
with rude pictures representing buffalo, deer
and ravens, who seemed to be in full flight.</p>

<p>“Now, when we get this on, the white
man’s rifle won’t amount to a row of pins,”
said the squawman. “The weapon will refuse
to fire, or the bullet in it will be turned aside
and drop to the ground.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">Page&nbsp;125</span></p>
<p>“Who told you all this?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“The medicine man; and he is the one that
prayed to the Messiah while they were on
their way home, and he set them miles ahead
on their journey.”</p>

<p>Carl did not say anything, but his thoughts
were busy. What a pity it was, he thought,
that Ainsworth and Tuttle did not have on
those ghost shirts when General Miles’ force
came up with them.</p>

<p>“You see it is sewed with sinew,” said the
squawman, “and that proves that we must not
take anything into the dance that the white
man has made. We can wear anything that
we have made ourselves, but nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you are going to whip the
white man?”</p>

<p>“Not unless we have to.”</p>

<p>“And when you do whip him,” continued
Carl, “you will have to use the weapons he
made for you, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Well, that is a different thing,” said the
squawman, after thinking a moment. “Of
course we will have to use the weapons he
made for us, and why not? He brought all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">Page&nbsp;126</span>
this trouble upon us, and we would show ourselves
lacking in sense if we didn’t use his
own weapons upon him.”</p>

<p>“You say your shirt would not be of any
use to you if you were known to have shown
it to a white man,” said Carl. “How do you
make that out?”</p>

<p>“All I know is what the medicine man
told us,” said the squawman, packing his garment
away again in its dried buffalo skin.
“We are going to whip them easy when we
put our shirts on, but we don’t want your
folks to know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, before I write that letter to General
Miles you say you have some business to transact
with me,” Carl reminded him. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“It is this,” said the squawman, seating
himself once more on the bed. “You have
got lots of cattle there, more than you need,
and I want you to write me out a bill of sale
for a thousand head.”</p>

<p>“What will be the use of that? You will
not want the cattle until this fight is over.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but if anything should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">Page&nbsp;127</span>
happen, and our medicine man should be mistaken,
we want to get the cattle without any
trouble. You have left men on your ranch
to protect them.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have, and they will shoot down
anybody who comes around there fooling with
the stock. But your medicine man won’t be
mistaken. The grass is not green yet.”</p>

<p>“No, but our medicine man sees that our
people are getting impatient, and he has
agreed to shorten the time of the Messiah’s
coming until this winter. That is why we are
keeping up the dance so long—just to show
him that we are ready for him as soon as he
wants to come.”</p>

<p>Carl was astonished, for he had never heard
that there were people who could bring the
world to an end whenever they pleased. While
he was thinking about it a shrill voice on the
outside of the tepee set up a shout, and the
squawman jumped to his feet and went to the
flap of the door to listen. In a short time he
came back again, after speaking a few words
to the women who stood close about the tepee,
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">Page&nbsp;128</span></p>

<p>“It has come at last.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? The fight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. We have got orders to pack up
our houses and move up to the dance-ground.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI. <br />The Indian Policemen.</h2>

<p>For a few minutes there was great commotion
among some of the women in
camp, a few making preparations to strike
tents, and the rest hurrying off to saddle their
husbands’ horses. The braves did not do
anything except bring their weapons out of
the tepees and stand by until their nags were
brought up. Carl, seeing that no attention
was paid to himself, went out of the tepee and
took his stand by the squawman’s side.</p>

<p>“Do you see those men who are sitting in
front of their wigwams smoking their pipes?”
said Harding. “Well they are those who
don’t believe in the Ghost Dance. The soldiers
say they don’t want them to engage in
it, and that is enough for them.”</p>

<p>“They will be saved when the world comes
to an end as well as those who do believe in
it, will they not?” said Carl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">Page&nbsp;130</span></p>

<p>“Not much, they won’t,” answered the
squawman indignantly. “This world is going
to be destroyed and a new one made in the
place of it; and those men, who are perfectly
willing that the whites should come here and
steal all their land and drive away the buffalo,
will go somewhere, and no one will ever see
them again.”</p>

<p>“Where’s my horse?” asked Carl suddenly.
“Or are you going to leave me here?”</p>

<p>“Not as anybody knows of,” said the
squawman with a laugh. “You must go on
with me up to the other camp. I have been
trying for a long time to get hold of you, and
now that I have got you I am going to hold
fast to you.”</p>

<p>“How far is that camp from here?”</p>

<p>“About thirty-five miles.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell one of the women to saddle
my horse?”</p>

<p>“No, because the horse don’t belong to me.
The one who took your horse by the bridle
and stopped you is the one who laid claim to
the horse.”</p>

<p>“And who has my rifle and revolver?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">Page&nbsp;131</span></p>

<p>“They went to some others of the party.
Oh, you will never see them again.”</p>

<p>Carl was not much disappointed to hear
this. He knew that his valuables were all
gone, having become the property of those
who helped capture him, but there were certain
other things he had that he intended to
hold fast to—the revolvers in the breast of his
jacket. So long as they were not discovered
and taken away from him he would not give
up all hope of some day making a dash for
his freedom.</p>

<p>“Have you not an extra horse, so that I
can ride?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“No; the women have got all the rest—and
they need them, too. You will have to
walk; I don’t see any way for you to get
around it.”</p>

<p>The horse of the squawman had by this time
been brought up, and he swung himself into
the saddle, first making a motion to Carl to
keep close by his side. As they got a little
way out of the camp Carl saw that the crier’s
voice had been obeyed, for they fell in behind
a long row of Indians who were already taking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">Page&nbsp;132</span>
their way toward the new camping-ground.
They were mostly braves, the women having
been left behind to strike the tepees. The
squawman did not exchange a word with any
of them, and neither did Harding converse
with him as freely as he had done heretofore.
He did not want to let the bucks see how
familiar he was with a prisoner.</p>

<p>The boy was not accustomed to travelling
so far on foot, and before their journey was
ended he was about as tired as he could well
be. At length, to his immense relief, he discovered
the camp within plain sight of him.
It was situated on a plain which seemed to
have no end, with high rolling hills on three
sides of it, and on the outskirts were several
“sweat-houses” in which the braves purified
themselves while making ready for the
dance, and in the centre was perhaps a quarter
of an acre of ground on which the grass
was completely worn off. This had been done
by the braves while learning the Ghost Dance
from Kicking Bull. There were a large
number of tepees scattered around the edge
of the plain, but Carl had witnessed the sight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">Page&nbsp;133</span>
so often that he barely took a second look at
them. What he wanted was to get somewhere
and sit down.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that the men who dance here will
get dust enough in their mouths to keep them
from telling the truth for months,” said Carl.
“Five days! That’s a long time to keep it
up.”</p>

<p>“It is sometimes called the ‘dragging
dance,’” said the squawman. “The men get so
tired after a while that they can’t lift their
feet. Now we will pick out a good place for
my tepee, and then we will sit down. You
act as though you were tired.”</p>

<p>Harding kept on for half a mile farther,
picked out a spot that would do him, dismounted,
and pulled his never-failing pipe
from his pocket. Carl thought he could enjoy
a smoke and passed his tobacco-bag to the
squawman. The latter ran the weed through
his fingers and praised its purity.</p>

<p>“We don’t get any such tobacco out here,”
said he. “We have to eke it out by smoking
bark with it. Say, Carl, how much do you
get for scouting for that fort?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">Page&nbsp;134</span></p>

<p>“I don’t get anything,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“Do you get up at all hours of the night
and run around for that man for nothing?”
asked the squawman in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s no trouble. When I want
money I can easily get it.”</p>

<p>“That is what comes of your having more
money than you want,” said Harding; and it
was plain that he was getting angry over it.
“If I had one quarter of what you have got,
I would leave this country altogether.”</p>

<p>It was useless for Carl to tell the squawman
that the only way for him to get money was
to go to work and earn it, for he had tried
that plan on him while he was herding cattle
for his father; so he said nothing. He leaned
his elbows on his knees and watched the women
as they came up and selected places for
their tepees. When the squawman’s was put
up, Carl found that he was in a position to see
the Ghost Dance without going away from it.
He would learn something more about it,
then.</p>

<p>“Have your women got your tepee all
fixed?” asked Carl. “Well, I am hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">Page&nbsp;135</span></p>

<p>The squawman was hungry himself, and he
had ordered the fire to be built and the iron
pot to be placed over it. By the time that
Harding had smoked his pipe he arose to his
feet with the remark that he guessed grub
was about ready, and went into the tepee.
Carl kept close at his heels, and found that
the iron pot had been removed from the fire
and set in the middle of the tepee, with two
wooden spoons beside it. The squawman
took one, while Carl took the other and began
to fish what he liked best from out the
pot. That was all they had. The meat had
been fresh the day before, but it had been
cooked so many times that there was scarcely
anything left of it. But he made a pretty
good meal after all, and when he had satisfied
his appetite he filled his pipe, lighted it with
a brand from the fire, and went outside to enjoy
it.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be at all uneasy if I knew
where Lieutenant Parker is at this moment,”
thought he, seating himself on a grassy mound
beside the tepee. “I wonder if that horse has
sense enough to follow his own trail back to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">Page&nbsp;136</span>
the fort? And why didn’t they capture him,
too, when they took me? I guess the squawman
let him go.”</p>

<p>While he was busy thinking in this way
Harding came out, followed by his wife.</p>

<p>“I am going up to sweat myself, to make
myself ready for the Ghost Dance which will
come off to-morrow,” said he. “Don’t attempt
any nonsense now. These women will keep
their eyes on you.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you let me go with you?”
asked Carl. “I want to see what you do in
that sweat-box.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think on the whole that you had
better stay here,” said Harding. “The bucks
don’t like your kind any too well——”</p>

<p>“Why, that ought not to make any difference
with them,” said Carl, who was evidently
astonished at the squawman’s words.
“I can see some of them here that have eaten
more than one meal at my father’s house.
They ought to think well of our family for
that.”</p>

<p>“That does not make any difference. You
belong to a class that has humbugged them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">Page&nbsp;137</span>
all the way through, and there are men here
in the party who have sworn to kill every
paleface they meet. So I guess you had better
stay here.”</p>

<p>Carl had no idea of attempting to escape
while the squawman was in the sweat-box.
There were too many bucks all around him;
and, besides, he had some preparations to
make. He wanted to get rid of his boots and
borrow a blanket to conceal his moleskin suit.
Thus equipped, he believed that when the
Ghost Dance was at its height he could slip
away, and those who met him on the road,
seeing nothing but the moccasins he wore and
the blanket wrapped around his head, would
surely take him for one of their own number
and say nothing to him. He believed that
he would try it, anyway.</p>

<p>“The only question is in regard to these
women,” soliloquized Carl. “If they get excited
and go down there to see the dance, I
can make it. If I once get over these hills
they will never see me again. But suppose I
am overtaken? Well,” he added, clutching
his hands about his revolvers, “I won’t be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">Page&nbsp;138</span>
tied to the stake without some of them going
with me.”</p>

<p>Carl glanced at the women and saw that
they had seated themselves opposite to him,
and, wrapped up in their blankets, appeared
to take no notice of anything; but he knew
better than to attempt anything while they
were on watch. They sat side by side, but
never exchanged words with each other. The
day and night wore on until it was twelve
o’clock, but still no sounds came from the
camp. Finally Carl grew tired of doing nothing
and went into the tepee. He picked out
a bed, the most comfortable one in the lot and
as far away from the others as he could get it,
and stretched himself out upon it. He thought
of Lieutenant Parker, wondered what the
Ghost Dance was going to be, and then passed
off into the land of dreams.</p>

<p>Morning came at length, and Carl raised
himself on his elbow to find the squawman
fast asleep on a bed by his side. He got up
and went to the door to examine things. He
saw that some changes had been made in the
dancing-ground since he slept. A tree, denuded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">Page&nbsp;139</span>
of all its branches except near the top,
had been erected near the centre, and there
was a staff, with a polished buffalo-horn on
one end and a plumed horse-tail on the other;
a bow with its bone arrows and a gaming wheel
with its accompanying sticks were made fast
below it. But prominent among all was something
that attracted Carl’s attention and drew
from him a sneer of disgust. It was the Star-Spangled
Banner.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what the Government has done
to be insulted in this way,” said he. “I think
they had better leave that thing out.”</p>

<p>For want of something better to do Carl
filled his pipe, and sat there and smoked it.
There were a few braves stirring about with
nothing on hand to do, and now and then one
came out of his tepee and started toward the
sweat-boxes. He was going to prepare himself
for the dance. For an hour Carl sat
there waiting for something to happen, and
during that time the camp became thoroughly
awake. One of the women came to the door
and motioned him to enter—a sign that his
breakfast was ready. The squawman still lay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">Page&nbsp;140</span>
asleep on the bed, but the kettle had been
taken off the fire and occupied its usual place
in the centre of the tepee.</p>

<p>“This meat is not half done,” said Carl,
trying to scoop up a piece from the middle of
the pot. “You ought to be at our camp for a
little while. They would show you how to
cook a breakfast.”</p>

<p>While Carl was engaged in lighting his
pipe at the fire, a commotion suddenly arose
in the camp. It did not take the form of yells,
as it usually did, but there were subdued
growls and the scurrying of feet hurrying
toward the dancing-ground. Carl wanted to
see what was the matter, and so he hastened
out. The dancing-ground was alive with Indians,
all thoroughly armed, who stood watching
the approach of three horsemen coming
toward them. Carl felt for his binoculars,
but they were away, keeping company with
his horse and rifle.</p>

<p>“Those are Indian policemen, if I ever saw
them,” said he. “What do they want here? If
I could only make them see me. Eh? What
do you want?” he added, turning fiercely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">Page&nbsp;141</span>
upon one of the Indian women who seized
him by the arm and tried to draw him inside
the tepee. “Get away.”</p>

<p>Carl abruptly thrust out his foot and tumbled
the woman over backwards. She fell all in a
heap, but at the same time she uttered a yell so
loud and piercing that it straightway aroused
the squawman, who came out with a rush.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">Page&nbsp;142</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII. <br />More Couriers.</h2>

<p>“If Tuttle was here now he would play
smash with you for serving his woman
in that way,” said Harding, laying a heavy
hand upon Carl’s arm and jerking him toward
the tepee. “Get inside, where you belong.”</p>

<p>Carl went because he could not help himself,
and the door was closed behind him.
He was alone in the tepee, the squawman and
the women having stayed outside to see what
was going to happen. Carl wanted to see,
too, and by looking around the tepee he found
a place where the skins of which it was formed
had not been stitched as closely together as
they ought to have been, or, if they had been,
the constant moving of the tepee had drawn
them apart. It did not take him long to
make this hole larger than it was, and by
placing his eyes close to it he found that he
could see everything that happened on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">Page&nbsp;143</span>
dancing-ground. The braves were still huddled
together awaiting the approach of the
three horsemen, and finally they began shouting
at them and waving their guns; but the
police did not stop. They were under orders
which must be obeyed. When they came up
with the braves the spokesman of the three
began a speech to which the Indians paid no
attention. They began yelling as soon as he
began speaking, and for a few moments a
great hubbub arose. In all his life on the
plains Carl had never heard such a commotion
before. Six or eight hundred Indians
could easily drown out three men, and Carl
could not hear a word they said. He expected
every minute that some excitable
young braves would shoot the policemen, but
finally the latter gave it up and turned their
horses toward the fort. Carl was greatly disappointed.
He left the side of the tepee and
seated himself on the bed, and a moment later
the door opened and the squawman came in.</p>

<p>“That was one time they did not make it,”
said he, giving one of his hideous grins.</p>

<p>“What did they want?” said Carl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">Page&nbsp;144</span></p>

<p>“They wanted to know if Kicking Bull
had gone home yet, and when somebody told
them that he had, they gave us the agent’s
order to stop the Ghost Dance.”</p>

<p>“Well, are the Indians going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Not much, they ain’t. We did not come
up here thirty-five miles for nothing. We
have got the ground right here, we are away
from everybody so that we can’t disturb them,
and we intend to go on with it.”</p>

<p>“The next time the agent sends men here
to tell you to stop the dance he will send an
army with them.”</p>

<p>“Let him. He will see some of the biggest
fighting that he has ever seen yet. We shall
be fighting for our religion, our homes, and
all that is dear to us; and when men get that
way, they generally stay until all are killed.
Now I will lay down and have my sleep out.”</p>

<p>“Are you not going in the dance?”</p>

<p>“I shall go in about the third day. By
that time some of the men will grow tired and
drop out, and I will take their place and stay
till it ends.”</p>

<p>“Must I stay in here all the time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">Page&nbsp;145</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no. You can go out and sit down
where you were before, but you had better
take this blanket along with you and wrap it
around your head so that you will be taken
for an Indian. Now mind you, don’t attempt
any more nonsense. These women know
when you ought to come in, and the next
time one of them takes you by the arm and
motions toward the tepee you had better
start. If you don’t, I’ll be after you.”</p>

<p>Carl took the blanket and went out; and
for five long days, except the time he took to
eat his meals and to sleep, he sat there with
his blanket wrapped around his head and
watching the Ghost Dance. To his surprise
he could see nothing about it to excite so
much admiration in the Sioux. When the
braves got ready to begin the dance, a neatly-dressed
young squaw walked up to the pole
with a bow and four arrows in her hand.
The arrows she shot to four different points
of the compass—north, south, east and west.
The warriors then separated and hunted up
the arrows, which were bound into a bundle
and tied to the pole. After that a medicine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">Page&nbsp;146</span>
man made his appearance, and surrounded by
the warriors, of whom there were a dozen in
all, began making a speech to them. This
was called the small circle, the other Indians
not having completed their “purification,”
which they did by going through the sweat-box.</p>

<p>The medicine man occupied nearly an hour
in making his speech—they were at so great
a distance from Carl that he could not understand
what was said—and then somebody else
took his place. It was a brave who had
passed into a trance during their last dance.
He must have seen some wonderful things
while he was in the spirit world, for he occupied
their attention for another hour, and
then he, too, gave way to another. There
was no yelling, except what the speakers made
themselves, but all seemed to be deeply interested.</p>

<p>Finally the braves who had been in the
sweat-box began to come out and join those
about the pole, and at last the large circle
was formed, and then began the dancing.
They took hold of hands and began moving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">Page&nbsp;147</span>
around the circle from right to left, and this
thing was kept up until the people grew so
tired that they could scarcely walk. The old
Indians, knowing that this was to be a dance
of endurance, barely lifted their feet, while
the young braves bounded into the air and
tried in various ways to show their enthusiasm.
In a short time the dust raised by the feet of
the dancers arose in clouds so thick that Carl
could hardly see the circle at all. When one
showed signs of giving out the others would
jerk him around the circle, until at last he
sank down from utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Well, if this is all there is of the Ghost
Dance I am going to bed,” said Carl about
twelve o’clock that night. “It makes me
tired to look at them.”</p>

<p>Carl had not neglected to keep his eye on
the women, who had sat all that day watching
the Ghost Dance, and he saw that they were
watching him too. When he arose and went
into the tepee they got up and followed him.
The squawman was still stretched out on his
bed slumbering heavily, and Carl wondered
if he were trying to make up for the sleep he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">Page&nbsp;148</span>
would lose during the two days that he expected
to pass in the dance.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Carl got up, he
went to the door and looked out. The circle
was there, larger than it was before, and some
of the braves seemed to be pretty nearly exhausted.
He noticed that there was not so
much bounding into the air as he had observed
the day before, the young braves who
had indulged in that practice having got
weary and given the dance up to somebody
else.</p>

<p>“It is the same old dance,” said Carl, going
outside and seating himself on his favorite
hillock. “The old men are in there yet, but
the young ones have gone out. What a dust
they raise! It is no wonder that the squawman
called it the ‘dragging dance.’”</p>

<p>He was getting tired of the Ghost Dance.
He had nothing to do but sit there and look
on. He thought that if some of the officers
at the fort could have seen it they would not
be so anxious to stop it, for the thing would
die out of itself as soon as cold weather came.
But then an Indian was long-winded. If his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">Page&nbsp;149</span>
medicine man had told him that the dance
was to be continued for ten days, he would
have found some way to get through with it.
He heard a rustling in the tepee, and the
squawman came out and stood beside him.</p>

<p>“Have you got a pair of moccasins that you
can let me have?” asked Carl, remembering
that he needed one thing more to complete his
disguise. “This boot hurts my foot so that I
can scarcely step on it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Harding, who turned
about and went into the tepee again. He
fumbled around there for awhile, and then
came out with a pair of moccasins in his hand
which he threw down beside Carl. “There
is some foot-gear which my old woman made
for herself to go into the Ghost Dance with.
You may find them pretty large, but if you
strap them up tight around the ankles I guess
they will stay on. What do you think of the
Ghost Dance?”</p>

<p>“Is that all there is to it?” asked Carl in
reply.</p>

<p>“Why of course it is,” said the squawman
in surprise. “I think that if you kept up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">Page&nbsp;150</span>
that motion for five days you would think
there was something to it.”</p>

<p>“Do you want that I should tell you the
truth?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I don’t want you to lie to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it is the biggest fake that
ever a party of men indulged in,” said Carl,
who did not expect that the squawman would
take kindly to this criticism.</p>

<p>“You do? I have a good notion to choke
you for saying as much.”</p>

<p>“You wanted the truth, and now you have
it. I would like to make you a bet. In less than
a year you won’t hear a thing of the Ghost
Dance. Your religion will die out entirely.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” said the
squawman, who seemed surprised to hear this.</p>

<p>“Because the Messiah won’t come. The
soldiers will come in here——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut your mouth. The soldiers won’t
have a thing to do with it. If they come on
us, we’ll whip them in a way that will do their
hearts good.”</p>

<p>“You will see. If I see you at the end of
a year——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">Page&nbsp;151</span></p>

<p>“You will not see me, unless that letter you
write to the general brings my partners back
to me.”</p>

<p>“When do you want me to write that letter?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the Ghost Dance is over.
You haven’t got any paper with you?”</p>

<p>Carl replied that he had not.</p>

<p>“There is one man now in the dance who
has got a lot of paper by him. As soon as he
gets through I will go to him for some.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Carl to himself.
“Now I will tell you one thing, and that ain’t
two—you won’t see me when this dance is
over. I will be miles on my way toward Fort
Scott. That is better,” he added aloud.
“These moccasins feel as though I had nothing
on my feet.”</p>

<p>Carl put his boots aside, filled his pipe, and
once more turned his attention to the Ghost
Dance. Harding also filled his pipe, but he
did not sit down.</p>

<p>“You are going to see more of it, are you?”
said Carl, as the squawman moved toward the
dancing-ground. “Now, what is the reason
I cannot go down there with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">Page&nbsp;152</span></p>

<p>“Your face is pretty brown, that is a fact,
but it will hardly pass for an Indian’s face,”
said Harding. “You will be safer where you
are. Those bucks don’t like to have white
folks see their dance.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Carl, as he stretched
his moccasined feet before him and wondered
how fast he could run if the Sioux
got after him. “I’ll stay here till the women
go away.”</p>

<p>That was a long time to wait, and Carl was
so impatient to be doing something that it was
all he could do to contain himself. He had
his full disguise now, his moccasins and his
blanket, and if he only had in his hand that
Winchester rifle which the squawman had
covered up in his bed before he left the tepee,
and the shades of night were closing around
him, he would not be caught as easily as he
was before. The evening of the third day
came around at last, and Harding began to
strip himself for the dance. He had nothing
on when he came out of the tepee except a
colored woolen shirt, moccasins, and a pair
of leggings which came up over his trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">Page&nbsp;153</span></p>

<p>“Now, Carl, I am off,” said he. “Do you
think I can stand it for two days?”</p>

<p>“I should think you might stand it as
long as anybody,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“I want to warn you that you must not
think of running off while these women are
here to watch you,” said Harding earnestly.
“You heard what a yell one of them could
give. Well, if these two set up a yelp it will
reach everybody. They will keep good watch
on you while I am gone.”</p>

<p>Carl made no reply, but sat there on his
mound and saw the squawman and his wife
go down to the dancing-ground; but he was
all awake now, and ready to improve the first
chance to seek safety in flight. But the trouble
was, the two women were as watchful as ever.
When he went into the tepee to get his meals
or to go to sleep, his keepers were close at his
heels. To save his life he could not get an
opportunity to escape one moment from their
vigilant eyes. The days wore on and at last
the dance was completed, and with a long-drawn
whoop the braves separated and all of
them started for their tepees, some of them so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">Page&nbsp;154</span>
nearly overcome with exhaustion that they
crawled on their hands and knees. The squawman
came also, and he had to be helped by
his wife. He went into the tepee and laid
down, and Carl, feeling somewhat discouraged,
followed him.</p>

<p>“That is one chance gone,” said he, looking
daggers at the two women who had watched
him so closely. “Now, when will I get
another?”</p>

<p>An hour passed in this way and the camp
was fast asleep—all except the woman who
sat by the door, and who, save when she was
relieved by the other woman, kept watch over
him while he slept. Suddenly there was a
commotion in the camp, and no one knew
what had occasioned it. A wild whoop, followed
by others at shorter intervals, rang out
on the still air, bringing the squawman to his
feet and sending him out at the door to listen.
It turned out to be a courier of some kind,
and he was detailing some news to the camp.
The squawman listened intently, and then
came back with the face of a demon.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">Page&nbsp;155</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII. <br />The End of Sitting Bull.</h2>

<p>“What is up?” demanded Carl, who
raised himself on his elbow and
looked at the man in surprise. He thought,
from the look of his face, that something
dreadful had happened.</p>

<p>“Young man,” replied Harding, coming
close to the place where the scout lay, hissing
out the words from between his clenched teeth
and shaking both his brawny fists under his
nose, “the English language is not strong
enough to make me do this subject justice.
You are at the end of your rope, and I would
not give two cents for your life. Nobody
knows, except the few who were with me
when you were captured, that I have got you
a prisoner here in the camp; but if one of
those warriors chooses to split on me, you
would be food for the wolves in less than half
an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">Page&nbsp;156</span></p>

<p>“Well, can’t you tell me what is the matter?”
exclaimed Carl, growing more surprised.
“I haven’t been doing anything.”</p>

<p>“No, but your kind have. Sitting Bull is
murdered—shot through the body by Bull
Head and Red Tomahawk, who were men
that he has led into action more than once.”</p>

<p>A wonderful thrill went all through Carl
Preston as he listened to these words. Sitting
Bull was dead! How often had he wished
for that very thing to happen, but he had
never dreamed that it would be done by some
of his own men. The squawman watched him
closely to see how he took the news, but Carl
never showed in his countenance what his
feelings were. He could have listened to the
worst news that any boy ever heard, but he
wouldn’t show it in his face.</p>

<p>“Why, how did it happen?” said he, knowing
that he must say something.</p>

<p>“You know as much about it as I do,” returned
the squawman. “Now the next thing
is——”</p>

<p>He turned and spoke some words to the
Indian women; but Carl, although he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">Page&nbsp;157</span>
been on the plains all his life, could not understand
him. He hated an Indian as he
hated nothing else on earth, and he had not
taken the pains that some people do to acquire
a knowledge of their language. But the Indian
women understood him, and straightway
set up a howl as if they had lost some of their
friends. One would think they were professional
criers who had been hired to shed
abundant tears over Sitting Bull’s untimely
death.</p>

<p>“Can’t you keep still for a minute?”
shouted the squawman, shaking both his fists
at the women, and forgetting in his excitement
that he had been addressing them in their own
language. “You two stay here and watch
this prisoner while I go down and see how it
all came about. You had better keep your
eyes on him, for the Indians may come up
and call for him at any moment.”</p>

<p>The squawman plunged through the door
and went out, but he left three excited women
behind him. They wanted to learn
the full particulars of the murder of Sitting
Bull the same as the squawman did, but for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">Page&nbsp;158</span>
time they kept their places on the bed, comparing
notes with each other and howling
alternately. Finally one arose to her feet and
slipped through the door, and she had been
gone but a little while before another went
out.</p>

<p>“I tell you the time is coming for me to
make a strike for freedom,” soliloquized Carl,
drawing his feet under him so that he could
go out of the other side of the tepee if this one
should follow the example of her comrades.
“If I once get out of this tepee, I bet they will
never see me again.”</p>

<p>Carl did not know much about women, but
he naturally judged of what he would have
done himself if he were left with a task on his
hands in which he was not particularly interested.
He would not have sat there alone in
suspense while all the rest of the camp, men,
women and children, were out to hear the report
of the scout and get all the news. She
sat uneasily on her bed, but finally got up
and went to the door. As she did so a long,
mournful howl, followed by a chorus of yells
which denoted that some of the tribe were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">Page&nbsp;159</span>
growing excited, came to her ears, and that
was more than she could stand. In an instant
she opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Almost any one who was placed in Carl
Preston’s situation would have been thrown
off his balance by this unlooked-for incident,
coming as it did on the heels of his disappointment
in regard to the Ghost Dance,
but it had no effect upon the scout. His face
never changed its color, and his hands never
trembled a particle. Quietly he arose to his
feet and approached the door. It was dark
outside, and he could not see a single thing.
The yells had ceased now, and the braves
were listening to a speech from somebody.</p>

<p>“Now is my chance, if ever,” said Carl,
going back to the squawman’s bed and hastily
tumbling the buffalo robes and blankets aside.
“If I stay here I will surely be staked out,
and I believe I would rather die at once.”</p>

<p>Carl speedily found the Winchester of
which he was in search, together with a murderous-looking
knife, which he proceeded to
buckle around his waist. Then he caught up
the rifle, drew his knife, and with two quick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">Page&nbsp;160</span>
steps approached the side of the tepee opposite
the door. One slit with his knife and he was
free; or at least he was free until the Sioux
got after him and captured him. With long,
noiseless strides he took his way over the hill
in front of which the tepee was pitched, and
then turned abruptly off to the right and followed
a direction exactly contrary to the one
in which he wanted to go. Fort Scott lay
pretty near south of him, and he argued that
when the Sioux came to pursue him, which
would be in the course of a few minutes at the
very farthest, they would turn in the direction
of the fort. When they had given up the
pursuit he would turn around and follow his
rightful road.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the squawman, having left his
prisoner, as he supposed, in safe hands, broke
into a run, and arrived at the dancing-ground
just as the medicine man began his speech.
He was urging the warriors to take to the
warpath immediately and avenge the death
of Sitting Bull. For a time it seemed as
though he would succeed in arousing the
anger of the Sioux to fever heat; but when it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">Page&nbsp;161</span>
came right down to the point, their chief man
was gone, and there was no one ready to take
his place. After he got through, the scout,
who had brought the news to the camp, took
upon himself the part of orator. He gave a
pretty strict account of the death of Sitting
Bull, and we will go on and tell it in our own
way, for it was a long time before Carl heard
the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>It happened on the morning of December
14th, although the arrest was not made until
the 15th. At that time a courier came from
Grand River with the news that Sitting Bull
had received an invitation to appear at Pine
Creek Agency, for the Messiah was about to
appear. Sitting Bull at once resolved to go,
sending a request to his agent for permission
to do so; but at the same time he saddled his
horses, to be ready to take a long and hard
ride in case that permission was refused.
The agent saw that something must be done
immediately, and he at once held a consultation
with General Miles, during which it was
decided that the arrest should take place on the
15th. The arrest was to be made by the Indian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">Page&nbsp;162</span>
police, assisted by a detachment of troops, who
were to follow within supporting distance.</p>

<p>The next thing was to inform the police of
what was expected of them. There was already
a camp of twenty-eight policemen under Lieutenant
Bull Head, a man of undoubted courage,
and who afterward shot Sitting Bull,
about forty miles from Standing Rock Agency;
and couriers were at once dispatched in other
directions to order the force to concentrate on
Sitting Bull’s house, so as to make the arrest
on the following morning. This happened
about sundown; but with loyal promptness
the Indians mounted their horses, and by
riding from one agency to another they collected
forty-three trained and determined
policemen to carry out their orders. In accomplishing
this service Sergeant Red Tomahawk
covered the distance of forty miles in
four hours and a quarter; and another, Hawk
Man, made a hundred miles in a roundabout
way, over an unfamiliar road, in twenty-two
hours. So it seems that those who found fault
with the Indians’ promptness did not know
what they were talking about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">Page&nbsp;163</span></p>

<p>By daylight the next morning the policemen
surrounded Sitting Bull’s house. He had
two log cabins built a few rods apart, and in
order to make sure of their man eight Indians
entered one house while ten went into the
other, the rest remaining on guard outside.
They found Sitting Bull asleep on the floor of
the larger house. He was awakened, and told
he was a prisoner and must go to the agency.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sitting Bull. “I will
dress and go with you.”</p>

<p>He then sent one of his wives to the other
house to get some clothes that he intended to
wear, and requested that his favorite saddle-horse
might be made ready for him to ride;
and this was done by the police. On looking
around the house they found two rifles and
several knives, which they took possession of.</p>

<p>Now Sitting Bull seems to have changed
his mind, for he decided that he would not go
with the police, after all. Probably one thing
that forced him to come to this decision was
the appearance of his son, Crow Foot, seventeen
years of age, who urged his father to give
the war-whoop and not stir one step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">Page&nbsp;164</span></p>

<p>“Father, you have often given the war-whoop;
give it now, when there are two hundred
men to assist you,” shouted Crow Foot,
standing in front of Sitting Bull and striving
to push away the police who were guarding
him. “You shall not go to the fort. Give
the war-whoop now.”</p>

<p>While this commotion was going on his followers
to the number of one hundred and fifty
men had congregated about the house, and by
the time he was dressed an excited crowd of
Indians had surrounded the police and were
pressing them to the wall. When Sitting
Bull came out and saw how many men he had
to depend on, and compared them with the
small number of police, he determined that he
had gone far enough.</p>

<p>“I will not go to the fort,” said he in a
terrible rage. “You will shut me up there
until I am as white as the snows on the top
of the mountain. My children here will
rescue me.”</p>

<p>That was all that was needed on the part
of Sitting Bull to draw on a fight. While
the majority of the police were trying to clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">Page&nbsp;165</span>
the way, one of his men turned and shot Bull
Head in the side.</p>

<p>“Now is the chance to see if your ghost
shirts will do what you say they will!”
shouted the lieutenant; and, though mortally
wounded, shot Sitting Bull through the head.
Almost before the smoke of the revolver had
died away, Red Tomahawk, who guarded the
prisoner behind, came to the relief of his chief,
and Sitting Bull dropped dead in his tracks.</p>

<p>Then began a hand-to-hand fight of forty-three
police against one hundred and fifty
Indians. Catch-the-Bear, the man who fired
the first shot and was the means of giving Bull
Head his mortal wound, and Crow Foot, were
killed; and after a hard fight the trained
policemen drove their assailants into a piece
of timber close by. Then they returned to
the house, carried their dead and wounded
into it, and held it for two hours, until the
arrival of the troops. During the fight the
Indian women attacked the police with knives
and clubs; but in spite of the excitement the
policemen simply disarmed them and put them
in one of the houses under guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">Page&nbsp;166</span></p>

<p>The fight lasted but a few minutes, but it
was fatal to some of the contestants. Six of the
policemen were killed or mortally wounded,
and eight of the Indians, in spite of their
ghost shirts, were sent to the happy hunting-grounds.
The warmest praise was given to
the policemen by those who knew all the circumstances,
for some of those who faced death
had near relatives opposed to them.</p>

<p>The war that had so long been predicted by
the soldiers had now fairly commenced. Some
of the Indians who were engaged in the effort
to release Sitting Bull fled to the Bad Lands,
but the majority at once made preparations to
go to their agent and surrender. That was
what the courier, who was at that moment
speaking to the Indians, wanted them to do;
but the most of them were for gathering up
their tepees and joining those who had retreated
to the Bad Lands, for if they once got
among them the soldiers would find it a desperate
task to whip them. Of course this
raised a discussion which became fiercer as the
talking progressed, until finally an Indian
jumped into the midst of the disputants and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">Page&nbsp;167</span>
succeeded in commanding attention so that he
could speak.</p>

<p>“You talk mighty big about going to the
Bad Lands and fighting the whites,” said he,
“but before you do that I want you to decide
the fate of a prisoner who is now held by the
camp. A white man was captured while
passing through our lines six days ago, and I
am one of the few who took him.”</p>

<p>The yells which broke out on every side
were appalling. The braves crowded up
around the speaker, shook their weapons in
his face, and threatened him with all sorts
of punishment. The idea of a prisoner being
captured while they were not on the warpath
was a little too much for the Indian to stand.
He could not comprehend it. The speaker
waited until their anger had somewhat subsided,
and then went on:</p>

<p>“Those ghost shirts you are making so
much fuss about will not help you one bit,”
said he. “They are nothing but buckskin,
and the white people’s bullets will go through
them very easily. Now, I want all of you
who are willing to go to the agent and surrender,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">Page&nbsp;168</span>
to go with me; and all of you who
want to fight, go to the Bad Lands.”</p>

<p>The squawman, who stood around listening,
heard all that was said about his prisoner, and
he was remarkably uneasy over it. If the
Indians proved to be so angry at one of their
number as to threaten his life, what would
they do to him? Those who wanted to surrender
would probably take the prisoner
along with them and give him up to the agent
as a proof of their good will, while those who
wanted to go to the Bad Lands and fight it
out would no doubt kill him at once.</p>

<p>“And even if they don’t include me in the
killing I might as well be alone, for there are
my partners who will go to jail,” said the
squawman, who looked all around to make
sure that there was nobody watching him, and
then started for his lodge. “It was a mighty
fool trick of me, my capturing that fellow,
and I am sorry I did it. I wish he was back
at the fort, where he belongs.”</p>

<p>Upon arriving at his lodge he lifted the
door, but stopped very suddenly when he
caught a view of the interior of it. His bed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">Page&nbsp;169</span>
was torn up, his weapons were gone, and an
opening in the tepee directly opposite the
door told the story of the escape. The women
were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV. <br />An Interview in the Woods.</h2>

<p>The squawman stood as if thunderstruck,
but he understood the story as well as
if it had been explained to him. The women
had got tired of staying back there in suspense
while their comrades were learning the full
history of Sitting Bull’s death, and, impelled
by their curiosity, had gone to hear about it
too, and Carl, the Trailer, had taken the only
chance there had been given him to escape.
That was all there was of it. But there were
other questions that came to Harding while
he reflected on these things. What would the
Sioux do to him? There was one question
which divided the Dacotas into two parties,
and the thing must be settled then and there
without a moment’s delay. Some of them
were going to start for the Bad Lands before
the troops came to hem them in, and the
others were equally determined to go to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">Page&nbsp;171</span>
agent and surrender. He knew that the
fighting members of the tribe would soon be
up there to demand the prisoner at his hands,
and that the rest would come along to protect
him; and both parties were so strong, and so
bent on having things turn out in their favor,
that it was possible there might be bloodshed
before the matter was settled.</p>

<p>“I am in a fix,” thought the squawman, as
these thoughts came flooding upon him, “and
I don’t know what to do. The prisoner is
gone, and that is all there is of it. I wish I
had let him go in the first place.”</p>

<p>At this moment wild whoops and yells came
from the dancing-ground, and as they seemed
to approach nearer and grow louder as they
came closer to his lodge, the squawman was
aroused into action. He was not simple
enough to join in with the fighting members
of the tribe. He knew that they would be
whipped sooner or later, and what was there
to hinder him from going under the sod?
He was not quite ready to do that; and after
listening a moment to the howls of rage that
came to his ears he dashed through his tepee,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">Page&nbsp;172</span>
passed out of the slit that Carl had made with
his knife, and ascended to the top of the hill.
On the way up he came to a decision.</p>

<p>“That boy ain’t gone toward the fort,”
said the squawman to himself. “He is much
too smart to be captured in that way. He
went off in this direction, and when the Sioux
get weary of looking for him he will come
about and strike for the fort.”</p>

<p>Acting upon the thoughts that passed
through his mind, the squawman turned
away from the fort and followed a course that
led him squarely on to the Trailer’s hiding-place.
His ears told him pretty nearly what
was going on in the camp. He knew, by the
yells which broke out with redoubled force,
when the Indians discovered the hole through
the side of the tepee by which Carl had made
his escape; and three or four of the young
braves, who were anxious to get somebody’s
scalp to wear to the Bad Lands, came along
the base of the hill looking for Carl, but they
turned toward the fort. The rest of the Indians
stopped in his tepee, and after a chorus
of loud yells from both parties they finally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">Page&nbsp;173</span>
ceased. Somebody was making them a
speech.</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t come any farther,” said
the squawman anxiously. “If they will only
just listen to that friend’s advice and go away,
Carl is all right.”</p>

<p>It takes an Indian forever to make up his
mind whether to do a thing or not, and for a
long time it was uncertain who would gain the
mastery—the fighting members, who were
anxious to kill Carl, or those who wanted to
go to the agent and surrender. But at length
the yells died away, those who were going to
the Bad Lands having wasted time enough,
and the others, who wanted to go to the agent,
drawing away to their tepees, leaving the rest
to do as they pleased in the matter. When
the fighting members of the tribe saw their
companions leaving them they became
alarmed and left the squawman’s tepee in a
body, and thus the dispute was brought to an
end. Carl was given a fair opportunity for
his escape, but he did not know it until afterward.
The young braves who had gone
along toward the fort had not yet returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">Page&nbsp;174</span></p>

<p>The hill along which the young scout had
taken his hurried flight was covered with a
dense mass of willows, and the squawman had
stopped in them as soon as he heard the commotion
at his tepee. A short distance in
front of him, but not in plain sight, was another
figure, who stood with his gun at a ready and
his finger on the trigger. It was Carl, the
Trailer, who was determined that two or three
of his pursuers should not get off scot-free in
case he was discovered. He saw the squawman
when he came up, and, if Harding had
only known it, his life hung by a thread.
When the yells of the Indians had ceased,
and all became quiet again, the squawman
proceeded to carry out the resolution he had
formed while making his way to the top of
the hill.</p>

<p>“Carl!” said he, in a low and cautious
whisper.</p>

<p>There was no answer returned. The figure
of the scout was drawn a little higher, and the
muzzle of his rifle covered the man’s breast.</p>

<p>“Carl!” repeated the squawman in louder
and more anxious tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">Page&nbsp;175</span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” came the answer
this time. “Throw your hands up. I
can see very plainly, and if you make a loud
noise you are booked for the other world.”</p>

<p>The hands of the squawman were at once
raised above his head, and he tried in vain to
make out the dim and shadowy form of the
young scout among the bushes; but Carl was
secure in his concealment.</p>

<p>“Have you got any cartridges about you?”
was the next question.</p>

<p>“Nary one. Every one I had is in that
weapon.”</p>

<p>“You see I took your rifle to help me
along,” returned Carl. “How did you know
where to find me so easily?”</p>

<p>“I knew you did not go toward the fort,
and I knew, too, that you could not have gone
far in these bushes,” replied the squawman.
“I want to tell you that your way of escape
is open to you.”</p>

<p>“You did not follow me on purpose to tell
me that, did you? I knew it when the Indians
quit yelling. Now, how does it come?”</p>

<p>“Some of the tribe are bound to get into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">Page&nbsp;176</span>
the Bad Lands to fight it out, and the others
are going to the agent to surrender,” said
Harding. “One wanted to kill you and the
rest did not want to; so, between them, you
got off without much pursuit. You can go
straight to the fort if you want to; but be
careful of those men who are going to the Bad
Lands. They are on the warpath now.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you wanted to tell me?” asked
Carl.</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t,” said the squawman. “Are
you going to leave me without any weapons?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I can do anything else.
I would be mighty foolish to turn this gun
into your own hands. I will take it to the
fort, and you can come there and get it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that it is impossible for
me to do that?” said the squawman in alarm.
“If you take the rifle with you to the fort I
am done for. The commanding officer will
begin to ask me about those stages that were
held up some time ago.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Carl thoughtfully. “You
see you got yourself into a bad scrape by going
with those fellows. Well, I will see what I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">Page&nbsp;177</span>
can do for you. You are sure you don’t want
any cattle from me, are you?”</p>

<p>“Nary one. I would not have asked you
for them, but I was hard up. I wanted money,
and didn’t care how I got it.”</p>

<p>“And there is another thing I want to tell
you, Harding,” said Carl. He saw the squawman’s
hands come down, but by that time he
had lowered his rifle to the ground and drawn
one of his revolvers, with which he covered
the man’s head. “Do you know that your
partners have been sent to the Leavenworth
jail by this time?”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the squawman.</p>

<p>“Well, they have, and so you can see that
it would be of no use for me to write that letter
to General Miles.”</p>

<p>“When did that happen?” asked Harding,
who was astonished by this revelation.</p>

<p>“About two weeks ago. You see, the soldiers
around here don’t wait to see how things
are coming out. The general was convinced
of those fellows’ guilt, and he sent them to jail
without the least delay; so you are alone in
being a squawman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">Page&nbsp;178</span></p>

<p>Harding was unstrung by this information.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone you, what made you agree to
write that letter for?” said he; and the words
came hissing out between his clenched teeth
in a way that would have made Carl afraid
of him had their circumstances been reversed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I agreed to write it,”
said Carl. “If I did so, I did it simply to
gain time toward effecting my escape. You
would have agreed to it yourself if you had
been in my place.”</p>

<p>“If the general gets his grip on me——”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is bound to get you some time, be
that sooner or later; and when he gets hold
of you, you will have to go to Leavenworth
jail too.”</p>

<p>The squawman plainly saw how this thing
could be brought about. If he went with
those of the tribe who surrendered he would
be hemmed in by soldiers, somebody would be
sure to see and recognize him, and he would
be put under arrest immediately. If he went
with those who were already escaping to the
Bad Lands he would, like them, be whipped
in a few days, and there, too, the soldiers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">Page&nbsp;179</span>
would bother him. He was not such a bold
man as some might suppose. He was ready
enough to slip up on a man behind his back
and bushwhack him, but when it came to
meeting one in a fair fight—that was a little
bit too much for the squawman. While he
was thinking about it the young scout spoke
again.</p>

<p>“I will do the best I can for you,” said he.
“I will take the cartridges out of this gun
and put it here in the bushes, where you can
find it in five minutes after I go away. You
can get some more cartridges of the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Say, Carl, you couldn’t say anything to
get me out of this scrape, could you?”</p>

<p>“No, I could not,” said the scout, somewhat
astonished at the proposition. “You
held up the stage, and that is contrary to law,
and some of you shot the driver. You will
have to suffer for that.”</p>

<p>“I used to herd cattle for your father,” said
the squawman at a venture.</p>

<p>“Suppose you did? What do you suppose
the general cares for that? You were caught
in the act of robbing him, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">Page&nbsp;180</span></p>

<p>“Well, I have had a lesson, and I will never
do it again. I will lead an honest life from
this time on.”</p>

<p>“If you are talking that way simply to get
me to say a word to General Miles you are
making a big mistake,” said Carl. “Nothing
that I could say would benefit you. You
have violated the law, and consequently you
have got to suffer for it, I tell you. Now here
is your gun, blanket and butcher-knife. I
will put them at the roots of this tree, and in
five minutes after I am gone you can come
and get them. The cartridges I shall keep.”</p>

<p>“But you will leave yourself without any
weapon at all,” said the squawman.</p>

<p>“Don’t fool yourself. I have a revolver in
each hand.”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you get them?”</p>

<p>“I have had them all the time. Now
good-by, Harding, and let me tell you one
thing: you might as well come up and stand
your punishment. You have every law-abiding
citizen in the United States down on you, and
wherever you go, you are not safe from arrest.”</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the little thicket after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">Page&nbsp;181</span>
that. Harding listened with all his ears, but
could not hear a leaf rustle or a twig snap as
Carl moved away from the spot. He waited
all of five minutes, and then moved up to take
possession of his property. After a little
search he found them all there, and with something
that sounded like an oath he took them
under his arm and made the best of his way
back to his lodge.</p>

<p>“I’ve either got to go with them fellows to
the Bad Lands, and get whipped when they do,
or I must go and surrender myself,” he said to
himself. “I know that little snipe could have
said something for me if he had chosen to do
it; but here I am, with everybody down on
me. Blessed if I know what to do.”</p>

<p>“I think he has more cheek than any man
I ever saw,” muttered Carl, as he moved
cautiously away from his place of concealment.
“He makes an attempt to rob father
and gets a bullet in him for his pains, and
then comes to me with the request that I will
say something for him! Mighty clear of it.
I would say something that would get him
stretched up by the neck, if I could.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV. <br />Five Years Before.</h2>

<p>About forty miles distant from Fort
Scott, in a quiet valley surrounded on
all sides by stately hills, the ranch of Mr.
Preston was located. The valley was fifty
miles long and half as wide, and the owner
had no difficulty in protecting his stock
during the winter storms which now and then
spread over the valley, accompanied by a
driving snow that effectually shut the cowboys
off from all contact with the outside world.
A river flowed through within a hundred
yards or so of the house, and on the wild fowl
that frequented its banks during the fall and
winter Carl Preston had received his first instruction
in wing-shooting. Game of nearly
all kinds was abundant, and it was no trouble
at all for the ranchmen who wanted a haunch
of venison to shoot a deer when they came to
the river for water. It was a quiet, happy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">Page&nbsp;183</span>
home, and Carl never would have thought of
leaving it had his father been spared to him.</p>

<p>The house was a rambling structure, built
of rough boards, dismal-looking enough on the
outside, but in the interior it was fitted up as
any boy would care to have it. A porch ran
the full length of the front of the house, and
one day in the month of June Carl Preston
sat on it, deeply interested in some work the
foreman was doing upon his saddle. Carl
was at that time seventeen years of age, and,
to quote from the herdsmen, with whom he
was an especial favorite, he was “as likely a
boy as ever stood up.” But there was one
objection to Carl, and that was, he never
would study his books. According to Colonel
Dodge, he found more excitement in horses
and guns than he did in anything else. He
tried hard to master a lesson that his father
gave him, but just as surely as anything happened
outside, he would go out to see what the
matter was. Did any of the cattle become
alarmed and threaten a stampede, Carl wanted
to be sure that the cowboy got ahead of them
and kept them from going out at the entrance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">Page&nbsp;184</span>
of the valley onto the prairie; or, if a horseman
was selected that morning at breakfast to
break in a bronco, Carl would happen on the
porch about the time he got ready to begin,
and see that the horse did not do the cowboy
any damage. At last his father became disheartened,
put away the books, and began
work on Carl’s education himself. He took
him into the field with him every time he
went, all the while discoursing upon some
subject in which he hoped Carl would be interested,
and in this way the boy learned
much that he could not have got out of books.</p>

<p>“So you think you won’t be lonely any
more after your cousin comes?” said the foreman,
stopping to pound down a waxed end
with his hammer. “Well, I hope you will
like him, but I am afraid you won’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preston had left home three days before
to go to Standing Rock Agency for the
purpose of meeting this cousin, and he had
purposely left Carl at home till he could see
what manner of boy it was that he was going
to meet.</p>

<p>This boy Claude was the only son of Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">Page&nbsp;185</span>
Preston’s brother, who lived in St. Louis.
During his father’s lifetime, for Claude was
now an orphan, Mr. Preston often had calls
for money and assistance, until he began to
believe that really his brother did not amount
to much. He got him situations, only to
have the man throw them up at last. To his
brother’s inquiry as to why he had done so he
always replied that it was something to which
he was not adapted, and begged for something
easier. Now the man was dead and Claude
was left alone. He wrote to Mr. Preston,
and, telling of the death of his father, asked
him what he should do.</p>

<p>“Now is the time for him to make good his
boasts that he is going to set me up in business,”
said Claude to himself. “Ten to one
he will write me to go out there, and that
is one thing that I don’t want to do. But then
he has money, and I will see what I can do
with him after I get out there. I will promise
him that if he will give me five thousand
dollars I will never bother him again.”</p>

<p>One thing that made Claude so free with
his uncle’s money was the conversations he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">Page&nbsp;186</span>
had often had with his father. He had heard
that all Western men were reckless with their
gains, and he thought perhaps Mr. Preston
would be equally so. What were five thousand
dollars to him? He could easily get it out of
the first cattle he sold. But now his worst
fears came to him. Mr. Preston, after holding
a consultation with his foreman—educated
man as he was, he needed somebody to go to—wrote
to Claude, and sent him money to come
to Standing Rock Agency. After he got
there he would still have a hundred and sixty
miles to ride, and, for fear that he might not
be able to stand the journey on horseback,
Mr. Preston would meet him there with a
wagon. Claude did not like the prospect of
going out there so far from everybody, but
still he packed up his trunk and went, and he
found his uncle ready to receive him. Carl,
as we said, had been left at home, because his
father was anxious to see what sort of a boy—or
man, rather, for Claude was nearly seven
years older than Carl—he had been so willing
to receive into his house.</p>

<p>“I hope you will like him, but I am afraid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">Page&nbsp;187</span>
you won’t,” repeated the foreman. “A man
who has lived all his life in a big city ain’t
agoing to be contented out here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he will,” said Carl, somewhat
disappointed at the foreman’s view of the matter.
“I will give him up everything I’ve got
if he will only stay here with me. There are
plenty of horses for him to ride, there is a
boat on the river, and——”</p>

<p>“That may all be,” said the cowboy, “but
when he is in the city he has more than that.
Where are the theatres for him to go to, and
the balls and sleigh-rides?”</p>

<p>“Why, Claude has not been to any of those
things,” said Carl in surprise. “You must
remember that his father was poor.”</p>

<p>“Supposing he was. What has this man
been doing during all these years? If he
had a position when his father died, what was
the reason he did not keep it?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know,” said Carl, who began
to have a faint idea of the way the matter
stood.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you just what’s the matter with
Claude,” said the cowboy, getting upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">Page&nbsp;188</span>
feet. “He did not have a thing to do when
his father was alive; he stayed at home or
bummed around some place waiting for his
father to give him money; and now, when
his father’s left him, he’s afloat and does not
know what to do. I tell you, he has come to
a bad place. If he waits for your father to
give him money he will wait for a long while.”</p>

<p>“You are prejudiced, and I hope that you
are mistaken. However, he will soon be
here, and I want you to meet him as civilly
as you can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will do that,” said the cowboy.
“He is coming here as your guest, and of
course I will take off my hat to him. But I
will tell you one thing, and that ain’t two,”
he added mentally, as he shouldered his saddle
and walked toward the corral with it: “I
believe that a fellow who will stand around
with his hands in his pockets, while his father
is so poor that he doesn’t know where his
next meal is coming from, is not a man who
will do to run with you. I shall keep an eye
on him.”</p>

<p>This made it plain that Mr. Preston had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">Page&nbsp;189</span>
talked rather freely with his foreman before
he started for Standing Rock Agency, and
that the latter’s suspicions had been aroused.
The cowboy was loyal to the family, and anything
that interfered with them was sure to
raise his ire. Carl did not know what to
think when he went away and left him sitting
there on the porch. Ever since his father
went away he had been impatient for his return,
for he wanted to see his cousin, and had
promised himself that he would try by every
means in his power to make his stay under
their roof agreeable.</p>

<p>“Thompson is mistaken—I know he is, or
father would not have received him under our
roof,” muttered Carl, as he turned himself
around on the porch and gazed toward the
entrance of the valley. “At any rate, I shall
not fall in with him until I see Claude and
judge him for myself.”</p>

<p>This much was settled, and Carl forthwith
dismissed all thoughts of his cousin from
his mind. His father had promised to be at
home on the afternoon of that day, and then
the matter could be determined to his satisfaction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">Page&nbsp;190</span>
His pony came up and thrust his nose
into his hand, and Carl suddenly thought of
something.</p>

<p>“I believe I will not wait for them to get
home,” said he, going to the end of the porch
where were hung the saddle and bridle which
he used in riding. “I will go down to the gap
and meet them.”</p>

<p>The pony—he was always called the pony,
and nothing else—did not raise any objection
to being saddled and bridled. He was as
gentle with Carl as a dog, although if anybody
else came near him he was apt to be
dangerous. This was the pony that Carl rode
when he got his name. He came home on a
leave of absence and told his father of it, and
the consequence was Carl was not allowed to
go back.</p>

<p>“I tell you those fellows have gone too far
in naming my boy,” said Mr. Preston in astonishment.
“Have you ever been in that
country before?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so far down,” answered Carl,
who almost wished that he had said nothing
about it. “I have been down pretty near to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">Page&nbsp;191</span>
Fort Belknap with Mason, carrying dispatches,
and that is as far as I have been.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what those Indians would
have done to you if they had captured you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I didn’t intend to be captured.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well, you don’t go back to the fort
any more; and if Mason comes up here I will
tell him what I think of him.”</p>

<p>Carl smiled as he put the saddle on his
pony and the conversation he had had with
his father came vividly to his mind; but,
being an obedient boy, he had stayed at home
after that, and listened to the stories the
scouts told, although he had no hand in them
himself. Some day he hoped to gain his
father’s consent to take part in them; but
until that consent was gained he would remain
there on the ranch, acting as cowboy.</p>

<p>Without taking any weapons with him Carl
mounted his pony and set off at a gallop, followed
by his pointers, which went with him
everywhere. It was three miles to “the gap,”
as he called it, which gave access to the valley
from the prairie, and he rode the entire distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">Page&nbsp;192</span>
without seeing anybody. The cattle
were all up at the farthest end of the range,
and had no business on that side of the house
unless they were stampeded. As he drew
rein, however, and cast his eyes down the
road, he saw a dim object at the farther end
which appeared to be coming toward him. A
second look started him down the road again,
and a brisk gallop of a mile or more showed
him that it was his father’s team.</p>

<p>“Now I will soon find out whether or not
Thompson is mistaken,” said Carl to himself.
“There are two of them on the front seat, and
one of them is a stranger. It must be Claude.”</p>

<p>Filled with curiosity, Carl kept his pony on
a lope until he obtained a nearer view of the
man who was a stranger to him. The result
satisfied him and his countenance fell. Claude
was neatly dressed as far as his outward appearance
went, and his gloved hands, which
lay before him, were as dainty as a woman’s;
but there was something in his face that was
not attractive. It had a hard look, a dissipated
look such as Carl had never seen before,
although he well knew what it meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">Page&nbsp;193</span></p>

<p>“Halloo! Carl,” said his father, who was
somewhat surprised at the boy’s silence. “How
is everything?”</p>

<p>“Father,” exclaimed Carl, extending his
hand to his sire, “I am glad to see you back
again safe and sound. And this is my cousin,”
he added, riding around the wagon so that he
could shake hands with Claude. “How do
you do, sir? I suppose you thought you were
never going to get here, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Claude with a smile. “I
knew uncle would not run me off into the
mountains and lose me.”</p>

<p>While he spoke the young men had been
making a mental estimate of each other.
Carl judged something of his cousin by the
grasp of his hand. He did not put any life
into it; it was as limp as a piece of wet rope.
Claude judged of Carl the same way, and
both of them came pretty near the mark.</p>

<p>“Drat the boy, he has the grasp of a
young blacksmith,” said Claude, noticing the
glove on his hand, which Carl had considerably
mussed during his greeting. “And this
is the kind of fellow I am to be associated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">Page&nbsp;194</span>
with all my life! I’ll bet the boy doesn’t
know putty. I have seen enough of uncle’s
life. I am going to get away from here as
soon as I can.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI. <br />What Claude Knew.</h2>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am going to get away from
here as soon as I can,” repeated
Claude, giving his cousin a good looking over
as he rode a little in advance of him. “I
know just what I will have to do when I
arrive at the shanty they call home. Uncle
has not said so, but I infer he is going to make
a cowboy out of me. If there is anything I
do despise it is a horse; and I know this
wild Indian will take great delight in giving
me the wildest one there is on the range to
ride. Then what will I do during my off
times? Not a billiard-table nor a bowling-alley
here! I wish I could think up some
way to get around the old man.”</p>

<p>Claude was filled with such thoughts as
these during his ride to the ranch, although
he tried his level best to keep up his end of
the conversation. He laughed when the others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">Page&nbsp;196</span>
did, when Carl told his father of the time that
Thompson had had breaking in the sorrel
mare—not because he could see any fun in it,
but for the reason that he did not want to let
his uncle and cousin see how completely his
mind was taken up with other matters. Finally
he aroused himself and began to take more
interest in what they were saying. It would
be well enough, he thought, to wait awhile
before getting away from there.</p>

<p>“Carl, do you see anything of the Indians
out here?” was his first question.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; we see them every day,” replied
Carl.</p>

<p>“But do you have any trouble with them?
I have heard that Indians are always on the
warpath, and that they shoot and scalp every
white man they see.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is not so. We are on the Sioux
reservation, and we know that they have been
peaceable ever since their surrender.”</p>

<p>“What did they surrender for?”</p>

<p>“To pay for killing Custer and his band,”
replied Carl, looking at his cousin with some
surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">Page&nbsp;197</span></p>

<p>“I believe I heard something about that.
Custer lost several of his own men, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so. It was the greatest
massacre that ever was known. Custer gave
up his own life; and, besides, he lost two hundred
and forty-six of his men.”</p>

<p>“Do you find any game about here?” asked
Claude, who plainly saw that it would not do
to talk to Carl about the Indians.</p>

<p>“More than we want. If you are fond of
shooting, I can take you where you can shoot
a grizzly bear inside of three hours after you
leave our house.”</p>

<p>“They are dangerous, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you would think so after
you have been in a battle with one. Last
week we took a man down to the fort, to the
hospital, who had his left shoulder all torn
out.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any books that are worth
the reading?” said Claude, who very soon
made up his mind that he didn’t want anything
to do with grizzly bears. “You must
have lots of time at your disposal——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">Page&nbsp;198</span></p>

<p>“Well, no. We have our evenings if we
are not on the watch, but then we are too tired
to do anything but sit around and talk. We
have plenty of books, however, and among
them there is one that I always admired—Scott’s
‘Lady of the Lake.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I have heard of that book.
Scott was a robber, was he not?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Carl indignantly. “He
was a Scottish nobleman. But he made one
of his heroes an outlaw, and he ran on until
he met his lawful monarch and killed him.”</p>

<p>Both the young men remained silent after
that. Carl was astonished that his cousin,
who was fresh from the city, where everybody
is supposed to know everything, should be
ignorant of little matters which he had at his
tongue’s end, and Claude saw that he must be
careful what subjects he touched upon to
avoid showing how little he knew. By this
time they were in sight of the ranch. It is
hard to tell just what kind of a looking building
Claude had picked out in his imagination
for his uncle to live in, but it was plain that
his amazement increased when he looked at it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">Page&nbsp;199</span>
He got down out of the wagon and was immediately
introduced to Thompson, who gave
him a hearty shake, and at the same time he
bent his eyes upon him as if he meant to look
him through.</p>

<p>“Everything is all right, sir,” said he in
response to an inquiry from his employer,
“and Carl has had one good, hearty laugh
since you went away. The old sorrel threw
me three times in succession, and I thought
Carl would never get over it. I think you
will find everything just as it was.”</p>

<p>Claude was shown into his room, which he
had to himself; and Carl, after turning his
pony loose, sat down upon the porch to think.
To say that he was sadly disappointed in his
cousin would not begin to express it. He
knew that the man was older than himself,
and that he would find it hard work to amuse
him; but he did not suppose that there was
going to be such a gulf between them.</p>

<p>Claude knew literally nothing outside of
billiards and bowling-alleys, and he would
have to go a long way from that valley to find
them. His thoughts, as he sat on his bed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">Page&nbsp;200</span>
gazing idly at the rag carpet on the floor, were
very much out of place for one who had just
come among relatives he had not seen for a
long time, and whom he had tired of already.</p>

<p>“I was a fool for ever coming out here, but
then I did not know that they lived so far
from everybody,” said Claude, running his
fingers through his hair and acting altogether
as if he were very much displeased with himself.
“I wish I were back in the Planters’
House, playing a game of billiards with somebody;
but now that I am here, I am going
to make the most of it. I don’t like my
uncle’s looks. He is a pretty hard man to
deal with.”</p>

<p>And we may add that these were his reflections
during the two years that he remained
an unwilling visitor at the ranch. He conquered
himself as well as he could, and stayed
there because he had nowhere else to go. If
he went to the city he would have to go to
work at something, and he thought that living
on the ranch was better than going among
entire strangers. He tried hard to learn his
duties; and being given a sober old horse that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">Page&nbsp;201</span>
it was no trouble to ride, and keeping always
in company with Carl, he found that he got
along better than he otherwise thought he
would. But there was one thing that came
into Claude’s mind that he would not have his
relatives know for anything. Mr. Preston
had an office which opened off the dining-room,
and every pay-day, and that came once
a month, he opened a safe in which Claude
had often seen huge piles of greenbacks stowed
away. He had not thought about this for
some time after he gained an insight into the
safe, but of late it had gradually come upon
him that if he could get into that safe unbeknown
to anybody, he would have enough to
keep him in idleness as long as he lived. It
scared him at first, but the longer he pondered
upon it the more he thought it could be done.
Besides, his uncle was gradually wasting away
from some form of incurable disease, and
Claude had schooled himself to look upon his
death with the greatest composure. Of course
Mr. Preston would not want the money after
he was gone; and as to Carl, he would have
the stock and ranch left, and that was all he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">Page&nbsp;202</span>
needed. If he could not make a living out
of that, he deserved to starve.</p>

<p>“I think that is the only way to make
money,” said Claude to himself. “It is true
I might try Carl after his father is gone, but
I don’t have any hopes of making him divide
the property with me. He will want it all
himself, for he is awful stingy. I’ll keep an eye
on that safe, and if he leaves the key in the
door, as I have known him to do a hundred
times, I’ll just open it and take what I want.
But where will I go after I have performed the
deed? Well, that will require some study.”</p>

<p>Every time Claude talked to himself in this
way he grew more and more impatient for
something to happen. One morning as he
was about to mount his horse to go out and
attend to the cattle he was approached by a
couple of rather seedy-looking men, who inquired
for Mr. Preston.</p>

<p>“He is out on the ranch now, but he will
be in before long,” said Claude. “Do you
want to see him for anything particular?”</p>

<p>“Yes—we want a job at herding stock,”
said one of the men, who answered to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">Page&nbsp;203</span>
name of Harding. “We understood that
some of his stockmen had left him.”</p>

<p>“They were three men who have got all
the stock they want and have gone off somewhere
to begin business for themselves. I
don’t know whether you could fill their
places or not. You don’t look like men who
had been in the habit of herding stock.”</p>

<p>And they didn’t, either. One of them, as
we have said, was Harding, and the other was
Ainsworth, and they looked just what they
were—regular squawmen. Claude had been
long enough on the plains to tell a stockman
when he saw him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we don’t,” said Harding, “but
we have been used to the business all our lives.
Is old man Preston out this way? Then we
will ride with you until we find him.”</p>

<p>Claude rode on ahead, followed by the
squawmen, and somehow he did not feel safe
in their presence; but before long something
that one of the men said opened his eyes and
made him feel that his uncle, by hiring the
two men in question, would make easy of accomplishment
certain plans he had formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">Page&nbsp;204</span></p>

<p>“You’re getting rich herding cattle, ain’t
you?” said Harding. “Well, it beats the
world how some men can get rich and do
nothing. If I had what old man Preston is
worth I wouldn’t never do nothing no more.”</p>

<p>“Neither would I,” said Claude. “But it
takes money to make money; haven’t you
lived long enough to prove that? A man who
hires out to be abroad in all sorts of weather,
and who loses his sleep of nights for the paltry
sum of forty-five dollars a month, don’t see
much money by the time the year is up.”</p>

<p>Here the subject was dropped, but enough
had been said to set each one to thinking.
Harding and his partner were hard up, to use
the language of the country. The provisions
their wives drew every week did not furnish
them with money, and how in the world they
were going to get funds was what troubled
them. If the truth must be known, they
came there to Mr. Preston’s house not for the
purpose of herding cattle, but with an eye on
the safe in the office. Claude, dull as he was
about some things, saw that, and instantly two
courses of action suggested themselves to him:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">Page&nbsp;205</span>
should he scrape acquaintance with the men,
in case his uncle hired them, and share the
proceeds with them, or should he pretend to
be on their side, find out what arrangements
they made in regard to robbing the safe, and
then go to his uncle and expose them?</p>

<p>“By gracious! here is another chance to
make money,” said Claude, so overcome with
his grand idea that it was all he could do to
keep from laughing outright. “If I go in with
them they will take the money and leave me
to whistle for my share; but if I go to my
uncle and post him, he will certainly reward
me for my efforts, and that will be better than
stealing. I tell you I will get the start of
that man yet.”</p>

<p>Claude was so impatient to reach his uncle
and turn the men over to him that he put his
horse into a lope, and in the space of half an
hour discovered his relative riding slowly
toward him. He simply said, “Here are two
men who want a chance to herd cattle,” and
then passed on, so that he could have an opportunity
to think over his new scheme without
being bothered by anybody. It was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">Page&nbsp;206</span>
his mind all that day, and when he went home
to supper that night he found the men, with
their hats off and their sleeves rolled up, in
the act of taking a wash.</p>

<p>“I guess uncle has hired you,” said he.</p>

<p>“Is old man—I mean is Mr. Preston your
uncle?” asked one of the men in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is my uncle easy enough, but
he treats me mighty mean. In fact he uses
all his hands mean.”</p>

<p>Claude looked all around before he gave
utterance to this falsehood, for if Thompson or
some of the older hands on the ranch had
heard him, it is possible that he would have
listened to the truth, plainly told. A kinder
owner to work for than Mr. Preston did
not exist, and every one who had earned his
daily bread on that ranch knew it. If the
three men who had left the ranch to begin
business for themselves could have heard it,
they would have told a different story. These
men had been at work for Mr. Preston a long
time, and each one carried, besides his stock,
one thousand dollars, with which to start him
on the road to prosperity.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII. <br />The Plan Discussed.</h2>

<p>“There!” said Claude, as he lifted his
face from the towel and gazed after
the two men who were walking into the
dining-room. “I have given them something
to chew on. I don’t know whether they believe
that Uncle Preston is guilty of meanness
or not—I rather think, from the expression
of their faces, that they do not; but it
will show them what <em>I</em> think, and perhaps it
will amount to something.”</p>

<p>Thompson, the foreman, was the one who
objected to Mr. Preston hiring the men, and
he showed it so plainly that it is a wonder the
men did not see it. During the week following
he would hardly pay any attention to
them except to give them their orders, and he
got through with that as soon as possible. At
the end of that time he found opportunity to
speak to Mr. Preston privately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">Page&nbsp;208</span></p>

<p>“So you have hired those two men, have
you?” said he.</p>

<p>“I have, and I didn’t think I could do any
better,” said his employer.</p>

<p>“I should not raise a bit of fault with them
if they were stock-herders,” said Thompson,
“but I know they are not. When you go
down to the fort make inquiries about them,
and you will find that they have Indian
wives. These men are making forty-five dollars
a month, and their wives are getting their
provisions for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you are mistaken. These
men must have had some object in coming
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they have. Where do you keep the
key to your safe?”</p>

<p>“In my pocket, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then it is all right. The cook will be
here while you are around the house, and it
will be dangerous for anybody to try to get it.
You will be around with me or with Carl——”</p>

<p>“And Claude, too,” interrupted Mr. Preston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">Page&nbsp;209</span></p>

<p>“Well, the least said about Claude the better,”
said Thompson.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t suspect Claude of having
designs on that safe, do you?” said Mr. Preston
in surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t suspect anything; but you just
take my advice and keep your eyes on that
safe. You’ve got most too much money in
there.”</p>

<p>“I declare this beats me! Things have
come to a pretty pass when a man cannot
keep in his possession what money he needs.”</p>

<p>“I am only just telling you what I believe,”
said Thompson. “I have had an eye on that
man Claude for a long time. When you pay
off the hands he is the last one in your office,
and I expect he takes particular notice of
where you put the key.”</p>

<p>“Thompson,” said Mr. Preston, suddenly
putting his hand into his pocket, “do me the
favor to keep this key. I am not as strong as
I used to be——”</p>

<p>“I know you are not,” said the foreman
sadly. “Time was when you would have
gloried to have somebody come here with the
intention of walking off with the contents of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">Page&nbsp;210</span>
that safe, but it ain’t so now. I will take the
key, and if anybody gets it, it will be when I
am laid out.”</p>

<p>Thompson rode off to attend to his duties,
feeling much better than he did when he began
his conversation with his employer. He
was hale and strong, a dead shot, as utterly
devoid of fear as it is possible for a man to be,
and it would be a dangerous piece of business
for one to attempt to put his hand onto that
key while it was in his possession.</p>

<p>“I feel all right now,” said Thompson, who
drew a long breath of relief. “I have been
worrying about that key ever since Claude
has been here, but now I would like to see
him get it. Many a time, before Claude came
here, I have seen Mr. Preston go off and leave
the key to that safe sticking in the lock for
weeks at a time, and nobody ever thought of
going near it. He has been a little cautious
about that ever since I spoke to him concerning
it. I’ll take the cook into my confidence.
He is a sure shot, keeps his revolvers hung up
where he can put his hands on them at an instant’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">Page&nbsp;211</span>
warning, and with him watching in
the house and me watching outside we have
the dead wood on them.”</p>

<p>The conversation had a very different effect
upon Mr. Preston. He became suspicious of
everybody. He watched his men and Claude
continually; and, though they were always
respectful in their manner toward him, he felt
that there was something behind it all. One
reason was because Claude had not yet talked
with the men. He was waiting for them to
“show their hands,” and that came about
right speedily. When the fall round-up
came, and the young cattle had to be branded,
it chanced that Claude and the two men were
together during the best part of the day. As
long as Thompson was with them they went
about their work in earnest; but when the
foreman went away, Harding, who seemed to
have been waiting for this opportunity, entered
upon the subject at once. He must have
known just how the matter was coming out,
or he would have been a little more cautious
about it.</p>

<p>“You say your uncle treats all his hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">Page&nbsp;212</span>
mean,” said he, addressing himself to Claude.
“I think he treats us all right.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he does you,” replied Claude,
“but he is only waiting for an opportunity to
turn loose on you. If we should let these
steers get away from us and start toward the
entrance of the valley, then you would see
what kind of a man uncle is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I blame him any
for that,” said Harding. “There are lots of
cattle on the prairie for them to mingle with.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be in my place once,” said
Claude. “You would get a blessing every
night for not doing your work up right. I
tell you, I am getting sick of it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you quit him?”</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t any other place to go.
Forty-five dollars a month is better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“You say he has lots of money in that
safe?” continued Harding, coming down to
the point at once.</p>

<p>“Oceans of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he keeps the key?”</p>

<p>“I do. He has it in his pocket; but then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">Page&nbsp;213</span>
he takes his clothes off every night and
throws them over a chair.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you could work your
way in there at night and get it? You
would have to be careful and not wake him
up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I could do it. Uncle sleeps like
a log.”</p>

<p>Harding went off at a lope to catch a steer
that objected to being rounded up, and when
he came back Claude waited for him to say
something more; but the cowboy seemed to
have had his talk out. After waiting until
his patience was exhausted, Claude broke in
with——</p>

<p>“Now, I want to know what you mean by
inquiring in regard to uncle’s safe? It’s
there in the office, and there is nobody going
to rob it, either.”</p>

<p>“How much money do you think he has
in the safe?” asked Harding. “It wouldn’t
pay to break into it and get nothing out.”</p>

<p>“He has eighteen hundred dollars in there
that I know of,” said Claude. “I remember
that when he sold those hundred head to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">Page&nbsp;214</span>
paymaster at the fort I passed through the
hall and saw a big wad of greenbacks on the
table. He got twenty dollars apiece for the
cattle, and that would clear him two thousand
dollars; but he has since paid out about two
hundred of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a power of money,” said Harding,
his eyes sparkling when he thought of handling
that amount. “That would be—how
much apiece?”</p>

<p>“For three of us? That would make six
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Now, can you keep still if I tell you something?”
asked Harding suddenly.</p>

<p>“Of course I can. I can keep a secret.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ainsworth and me have come here
with the intention of seeing the contents of
that safe before we go away.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“You do?” exclaimed Harding, looking at
him suspiciously. “Who told you of it?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. I just knew it from the way
you acted.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose anyone else suspects it?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. You have kept still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">Page&nbsp;215</span>
when other people were around, and I don’t
think anybody mistrusts you.”</p>

<p>“We will give you one-third of what we get
if you will go in with us and get the key.”</p>

<p>“I am in for it; but the question is, what
shall we do to keep the money after we get it?
The whole country will be after us.”</p>

<p>“And it will take more than the whole
country to catch us, too,” said Harding with
a grin. “We’ll go off among the Sioux Indians.”</p>

<p>If Claude had had any intention of joining
the squawmen in any attempt on the safe, this
proposition of Harding’s would almost have
taken his breath away. He had seen some
of the Indians during the two years he had
been there, and the idea of taking up his
abode with them was not to be thought of for
a moment. They were so filthy that he could
not bear to go near them; but he had another
motive in view. All he wanted now
was to get at Harding’s plans, and then he
would go straight to his uncle with them. He
was sure that in that way he would get a
reward for saving him from being robbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">Page&nbsp;216</span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” asked Harding.</p>

<p>“Will you feel perfectly safe from capture
while you live with the Sioux?” asked Claude.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. The Indians always have spies
among the white folks, and they would keep
us posted. They can’t catch us there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will go. When do you think you
will make the attempt?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow night, if my partner agrees to
it. I am getting sick of this cattle business.
I long to be back in my tepee, where I can
lay down and smoke as long as I please. I’ll
speak to my partner at noon, and I’ll tell you
what he says. Here comes that Thompson.
I’d like to get him out on the prairie where I
could get a fair squint at him with my rifle.
I would teach him to lay around and watch
his betters.”</p>

<p>“Here, boys!” shouted the foreman as he
galloped up; “you don’t drive these cattle
fast enough. It will be dark before we get
them down to the corral. You Claude! take
after that fellow and bring him back.”</p>

<p>Claude put his horse into a gallop and
“took after” the unwilling steer who objected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">Page&nbsp;217</span>
to going toward the corral; but he was grateful
to Thompson for sending him away, for he
wanted to have time to compose his features.
His chance for making money had come at
last. Of course there was a chance for him to
arouse the suspicion of the squawmen, who
would take speedy revenge upon him, and
that was one thing against which he must
guard himself. He would not be seen any
more in his uncle’s company than he had been
heretofore, and when Carl came toward him
for the purpose of helping him he had business
on the flank of the drove, at some little
distance away.</p>

<p>“I know I am all right now,” said Claude
to himself, “and the main thing must be to
keep myself all right. If I am seen around
in your company, and the squawmen shall
slip up on their plan of robbing the safe, I
will be the first to suffer for it. I’ll wait until
night, and then I’ll fix things as they ought
to be.”</p>

<p>But it seemed to him that night was a long
way off. The cattle were driven toward the
corral, the calves separated from them and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">Page&nbsp;218</span>
put in the inclosure, and amid the confusion
and noise that attended all this Ainsworth
found time to give Claude an encouraging
wink.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” whispered
Claude.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” was the reply. “We will see
you to-morrow night and tell you what to do.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Claude, looking all
around to make sure that no one was watching
him, “I am not to do anything but get
the key, am I?”</p>

<p>“No—that will be enough for us.”</p>

<p>“And I am to get my third of the money
as soon as we get it?”</p>

<p>“Sure. You don’t think we would try to
take it away from you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. You cowboys are
mighty reckless in handling money, and you
might tell me to look farther before you would
give me a cent.”</p>

<p>“As sure as you live and breathe we have
no such an idea,” said Ainsworth, opening his
eyes in surprise. “You get the key for us
and we will give you the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">Page&nbsp;219</span></p>

<p>“That is a little too far-fetched,” thought
Claude, as the last calf was driven inside the
corral. “You were almost too ready to
promise me that money. It must be pretty
near night now, and I am just aching to tell
my uncle of the plans that have been laid
against him. How much will he give me?
Five thousand dollars at least. If he gives
me less than that I shall be sorry I told him.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII. <br />“They’re in the Office!”</h2>

<p>It was long after dark before the cowboys
went to supper, but they had performed
a good day’s work, and felt jolly over it.
Claude was the liveliest one of the party. He
conducted himself in such a way that his
uncle looked at him with surprise, and he
more than once caught the angry glances of
the two squawmen fastened upon him with
amazement. But Claude didn’t mind that.
Within two hours he would see his uncle and
post him in regard to the robbery, and that
was all he cared for.</p>

<p>“You can look at me as angry as you have
a mind to,” he kept saying to himself. “I
will get a big sum of money for this evening’s
work, and then I can go back to the city and
live as I please. Five thousand dollars! One
can see a heap of pleasure with that.”</p>

<p>Supper over, Claude went out to take care
of his horse (we mean by that that he turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">Page&nbsp;221</span>
him loose with the other horses, to feed during
the night), and as he turned back to the house
who should come up but Harding and his
partner.</p>

<p>“Say,” said the former, looking all around
to satisfy himself that nobody else was within
hearing, “what made you act so during supper-time?
Do you want everybody about the
ranch to know what we are going to do?”</p>

<p>“No, but I felt so gay that I couldn’t hold
in,” replied Claude. “I don’t care what they
think. I shall soon have some money, and I
can go back to the city with that. I think, as
you do, that I am getting sick of this cattle
business.”</p>

<p>“You are sure you can get that key?”
asked Harding.</p>

<p>“I can try. If he keeps it in his trousers
pocket I can get it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all we want you to do. Now remember
and hold yourself in a bit. I am
afraid of that Thompson. We will have to
keep an eye out for him.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to shoot him?” asked
Claude in some alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">Page&nbsp;222</span></p>

<p>“Not if he behaves himself we won’t; but
he does not want to come fooling around while
we are in the office. We may not have a
chance to speak to you to-morrow, and we
want you to bear this in mind: as soon as it
comes dark, and everybody on the ranch is
asleep, you come out on the porch, and you
will find us there.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to saddle my horse, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can do that after you find us.
We will be out somewhere near the porch,
and you can slip in and get the key. That’s
all. Now, remember it, and you will know
just what you have got to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will remember it,” muttered
Claude, as the squawmen walked away. “I
must go and get my horse after the ranch has
been aroused. That’s a pretty idea! Now I
must go and find uncle.”</p>

<p>When Claude reached the porch, he found
Carl sitting there in company with his father.
Of course they were talking about the incidents
that had transpired during the round-up—how
this steer had got frightened and made
a bee-line for the prairie, and how that one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">Page&nbsp;223</span>
had charged upon Thompson, who narrowly
escaped being unhorsed—and they were having
a hearty laugh over them. It was not
Claude’s intention to say anything to his uncle
while Carl was about. He sat down in a
chair and waited impatiently for him to go.</p>

<p>“Well, Claude, you seemed to enjoy this
round-up a great deal better than you did the
one of last year,” said his uncle. “You must
have met with some amusing scenes out there,
judging by the way you conducted yourself
at the table.”</p>

<p>“I did not see anything to laugh at,” replied
Claude, “but I am more used to riding
on horseback than I was a year ago, and I
thoroughly enjoyed it. None of the cattle
charged upon me, and so I got off safe.”</p>

<p>In spite of Claude’s impatience, it was
nearly ten o’clock before his cousin thought it
high time he was going to bed. They had a
hard day’s work to perform on the morrow,
and they needed some sleep to prepare for it.
He bade his cousin good-night and went into
the house; and no sooner had he done so than
Claude made a motion enjoining silence upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">Page&nbsp;224</span>
his uncle, and went first to one end of the
porch, and then to the other, to make sure
that there was no one listening to hear what
he had to say. His uncle looked on with surprise,
and when Claude seated himself he
said:</p>

<p>“A person would think that you have
some secret to tell me. Why don’t you want
somebody to hear it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you will think it <em>is</em> a secret
by the time I tell it,” whispered Claude.
“Uncle, there are two men here who have
made up their minds to rob you to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>Claude thought that if that revelation had
been made to him he would have gone wild
over it. Instead of that, his uncle settled
back in his chair and looked at him without
speaking.</p>

<p>“They are Harding and his partner,” continued
Claude. “They say that the reason
they came here was to get a look at your
safe.”</p>

<p>“How did you find it out?” asked Mr.
Preston. He did not seem to be nervous at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">Page&nbsp;225</span>
all. He talked in his usual tone of voice, and
in much the same manner that he would have
discussed the round-up that was to come off
the next day.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why they came to me about
it, unless it was because I know where you
keep the key,” replied Claude. “I agreed
with them until I found out what they were
going to do, and then I came to you with it.”</p>

<p>“Where do they think they will find the
key?”</p>

<p>“I am to get the key, and I am to feel in
your trousers pocket for it. They are no cattlemen,
in the first place; and after they rob
you they are going among the Sioux Indians,
where they will be safe.”</p>

<p>“It is just as I expected,” said his uncle;
“they are two squawmen beyond a doubt.
You were to do nothing but get the key?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They thought that was enough.
I am not to be mixed up in the matter until
it is all over.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go ahead, and when you come
into my room I will come out to them. Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">Page&nbsp;226</span></p>

<p>This was all that was said. Claude sat
there in his chair and saw his uncle go into
the house, and he felt his guiltiness. Mr.
Preston did not say a word about rewarding
him, and acted altogether as though he did not
consider the matter of much moment.</p>

<p>“Does he intend to leave me out in the
cold, I wonder?” soliloquized Claude. “If
so, I am sorry I did not stay in with the
squawmen. He is suspicious; I can see that
plain enough. I wish the thing was over, and
that the men were safe among the Sioux Indians.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preston had not passed a sleepless
night. He got up bright and early, wished
everybody good-morning, and one would not
have supposed that he had listened to an
astounding revelation the night before. He
gave his orders in much the same way at the
breakfast-table, and when he had seen the
herdsmen go away he filled his pipe and sat
on the porch to enjoy it. But there were two
men about the house who, according to
Claude’s way of thinking, acted as though
they wanted to pitch into the squawmen then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">Page&nbsp;227</span>
and there, and end the matter. They were
Thompson and the cook. The former glared
savagely at them as he took his seat on the
opposite side of the table, and the cook hung
around the door of the dining-room, and that
was a thing he had never done before, and
waited for them to say or do something. Claude
was in a fever of suspense. He saw it all
plain enough, even if the squawmen did not.</p>

<p>“Say, Claude, you have been saying something
to the old man,” said Harding, as the
three moved off in a body to carry out Mr.
Preston’s commands. “If you have, you may
bet your bottom dollar that you won’t see any
of his money.”</p>

<p>As the squawman spoke he laid his hand
upon his revolver and scowled at Claude in a
way that made him tremble. He knew what
his fate would be if he did anything to confirm
the man’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“What would I say to the old man?” he
asked in a faint voice. “I am as deep in the
mud as you are.”</p>

<p>“What made the foreman and cook look so
cross at us?” asked Harding in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">Page&nbsp;228</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. He has just as much right
to be mad at me as he has to feel mad at you.”</p>

<p>“We will go on with our programme just
as we have planned it,” said Harding desperately.
“If the thing works all right, well and
good; if it don’t, it will be all wrong for somebody.
Mind that.”</p>

<p>The day drew on and night came on apace,
and still Claude had no chance to speak to the
two squawmen. He had been given his lesson
the night before, and he concluded that that
was going to do. Now that the time drew
near he was beset with fears to which he had
hitherto been a stranger. Claude knew by
the way Harding handled his revolver that he
was going to shoot rather than allow his plans
to fall through, and, although he had never
heard of his uncle doing such a thing, he
thought that he, too, would have recourse to
firearms. And where would <em>he</em> be about the
time the shooting began?</p>

<p>“I am really afraid I have got myself in a
scrape,” thought Claude, so overcome with
dread that it was all he could do to sit still on
his horse. “I never dreamed of their shooting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">Page&nbsp;229</span>
but that is the way all Western men have
of getting out of a difficulty. I wish I had
stayed in St. Louis when I was there. They
don’t have any shooting going on in that
place.”</p>

<p>Supper being over, Claude did not go out
to attend his horse as usual. He whispered to
one of the men to attend to it for him, and
during the evening sat on the porch with his
uncle and cousin. He sat there until ten
o’clock, and then Carl said good-night and
went to his room. His uncle sat still longer,
but finally arose and followed Carl, at the
same time laying his hand upon Claude’s arm.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” said he.</p>

<p>“It is all right so far as I know,” said
Claude. “I had a talk with them this morning,
and they said they would go on with their
regular plans. Be careful of yourself, uncle.
They are going to shoot.”</p>

<p>“I will look out for myself. You keep out
of the way.”</p>

<p>His uncle went to his room and Claude sat
there on the porch, literally benumbed with
fear. Finally he mustered up courage enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">Page&nbsp;230</span>
to go into his room and lie down on the bed
without removing his clothes. He lay there
until twelve o’clock, and then, everything
being still, he got up and sat on the bed.</p>

<p>“I wonder if those two men are as nervous
as I am?” said Claude to himself. “I don’t
intend to do anything myself, but I feel as
guilty as though I had been caught in the act.
Well, here goes.”</p>

<p>Claude got up and made his way to the front
door, and when he had opened it very cautiously
he saw Harding standing at the other
end of the porch. The man straightened up,
mounted the steps, and stood beside him.</p>

<p>“I thought you never was coming,” said
he, and he fairly hissed out the words. “You
see, if you had not come there would have
been some murder done in this house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you will not try that,” said
Claude.</p>

<p>“Then let the old man behave himself and
do just as he is told. Now take us to the
office, and then go and get the key.”</p>

<p>Claude pressed his hand against his heart
to still its beatings and turned back into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">Page&nbsp;231</span>
house. A few steps brought them to the door
of the office. It was light in there, for the
moon was shining out of doors, and the first
thing Harding did was to step across the room
and raise one of the windows, so that he and
his companion could have a chance for escape.
Then he motioned for Claude to go ahead;
but now another thought occurred to him.
Suppose Harding, instead of trusting him to
go alone into the room, should send his partner
with him? That would be a misfortune indeed,
for he did not see how he was to convey to
his uncle the information that the two squawmen
were in his office. He dared not hesitate,
but turned and went to his uncle’s
room, and to his great delight he went alone.
The men did not hear him as he walked
along the hall, and when he approached the
door of his uncle’s room, which always stood
open, he discovered a figure on the bed, and
he saw it rise up as he stepped across the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Claude!” said his uncle.</p>

<p>“It is I,” replied Claude in a trembling
voice. “They’re in the office!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">Page&nbsp;232</span></p>

<p>Mr. Preston immediately arose, and in his
hand, which he pulled out from under his
pillow, was a revolver. It looked now as
though his uncle was going to shoot, too.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">Page&nbsp;233</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX. <br />A Talk With His Uncle.</h2>

<p>“Be very careful of yourself,” said Claude
in an earnest whisper. “They have
their revolvers in their hands, and are ready
to shoot the first one who steps into the office.”</p>

<p>“I will take care of that,” said Mr. Preston.
“You keep out of the way.”</p>

<p>Claude stood in the door of his uncle’s room
and watched him as he moved with noiseless
steps toward the office. He reached the door
and went into it, and the next moment he
heard the word “Surrender!” spoken in a
loud tone, followed by the report of a pistol.
A yell came close upon the heels of it, and
after that the noise of the revolvers came faster
than he could count them. He felt sure that
his uncle had received his death-wound.
Almost at the same instant, as if they had
been waiting for this signal, there was the
sound of hurrying feet in the hall, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">Page&nbsp;234</span>
foreman and cook ran by with their revolvers
in readiness. They glanced in at the office
door, and then went on to the front door,
which they opened in great haste, and began
shooting there; but presently the sound of
flying hoofs came to Claude’s ears, which told
him that the squawmen had succeeded in
reaching their horses and were scurrying
away toward the entrance of the valley. A
moment afterward his uncle came out of the
office. His face was very pale, but Claude
could see that he was not wounded.</p>

<p>“They have got away,” said the foreman in
disgust. “Did they hit you anywhere, Mr.
Preston?”</p>

<p>“No, I am all right,” said his employer.
“But bring a light and we will see if there
isn’t some marks down here. Harding drew
his pistol on me, but I got the first shot and
he dropped the revolver out of his hand.
When he yelled so, I thought surely I had
him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="foiled">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">Page&nbsp;235</span></p>

<p>Of course the whole house was aroused by
this time. Every man who was asleep under
that roof was awakened by the pistol-shots,
and had come out, revolver in hand, to see
what was going on. Foremost among them
was Carl, who, when he heard the particulars
of the matter, ran to the front door and gazed
out into the night.</p>

<p>“It is no use, Carl,” said his father. “They
had their horses ready saddled, and of course
took themselves straight off. I am not hurt,
and that is one thing you ought to be thankful
for.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Harding’s weapon,” said Carl, as
the cook came in at that moment with a light.
“It is all blood, too. Why, father, I don’t
see how you missed them at that distance.”</p>

<p>“Probably my nerves had something to do
with it,” replied his father. “A year ago I
would have risked my chance of dropping
them both where they stood; but my skill
has gone from me.”</p>

<p>“Here’s some more blood on the window-sill,”
said one of the cowboys. “You have
probably marked them both.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hit each one of them. Now we
will go back, and go to bed. Claude, I owe
you something for this. If they had taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">Page&nbsp;236</span>
what there is in the safe it would not have
ruined me. A few days ago I had five thousand
dollars in there, but now it is safe in the
paymaster’s hands at the fort. How much do
I owe you, Claude?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, sir,” said Claude, as he
shook hands with Carl, who came up but did
not say anything. “I have saved your money,
and that is all I cared for.”</p>

<p>Some little time was spent by the hands in
talking over the incidents of the attempted
robbery, and everybody except the foreman
and cook were loud in their praises of Claude,
who had led the squawmen on till he got all
their plans. They were suspicious of Claude,
and it would require something more than he
had done to relieve them of it.</p>

<p>“Father, I have some fault to find with
you,” said Carl, as they were about to separate
and each one go to his own room. “Why did
you not take some one into your confidence?”</p>

<p>“I did. These two men were wide-awake
and came out as soon as they heard the pistol-shots.
I could not have found anybody better
than they, could I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">Page&nbsp;237</span></p>

<p>“No; but you ought to have had somebody
along to back up your shots. I believe I could
have done better than you did.”</p>

<p>This raised a smile on the part of all of
them, and they bade Mr. Preston good-night
and went to their rooms. Claude was the only
one who did not feel very good over it. His
uncle had said that he “owed him something,”
but he did not say how much.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he promise me the money
to-morrow, so that I can go back to the city?”
said Claude, as he took off his clothes and
tumbled into bed. “They must see that I
don’t want to live here. I wonder if I could
punch him up and get him to draw on that
five thousand dollars he has in the paymaster’s
hands? That is something worth thinking of.”</p>

<p>Morning came at length, and Claude got up
to find that he was treated with respect by all
hands except the foreman and cook. These
two did not seem to want anything to do with
him. Of course they bid him good-morning
and answered all the questions he asked them,
but they did it in a short way, as though
his talking bothered them. They were careful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">Page&nbsp;238</span>
not to let Mr. Preston see them in conversation
with him, for they knew that their employer
would take them to task about it.
None of the hands referred to the matter at
the breakfast-table, and in fact they seemed to
have forgotten all about it, and Claude listened
in vain for his uncle to mention the subject
of a reward. He finally concluded that he
was not going to get any.</p>

<p>“He is the meanest man I ever saw,” said
Claude, as he went out to saddle his horse.
“He lets me risk my life in saving his money,
and doesn’t give me anything. I wish to
goodness I had said nothing about it.”</p>

<p>A few days after this, Claude found a couple
of strange men in the house when he came
home to dinner. They were very different
from Harding and his partner, for they were
cattlemen on the face of them. They wore
their revolvers strapped about their waists,
had silk handkerchiefs around their necks,
and their hats, which lay beside them on the
floor, were sombreros of the widest kind.</p>

<p>“Well, Claude, it seems that you are not
out of this scrape after all,” said Mr. Preston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">Page&nbsp;239</span></p>

<p>“What scrape do you mean, uncle?” asked
Claude.</p>

<p>“Why, about that safe robbery. Harding
and his partner have gone among the Sioux
Indians, and are going to kill every one of us.”</p>

<p>“How did you find that out?” asked Claude,
his face growing a shade paler.</p>

<p>“These men, who have come down to hire
in their places, brought the news straight from
them. They are going to kill you on sight,
for they blame you as much as anybody for
their failure; and Carl they are going to
capture and keep until they can get some
stock out of him.”</p>

<p>“They say you talked to them very mean
in regard to Mr. Preston,” said one of the
cowboys with a smile.</p>

<p>“I never said a word to them in my life,”
said Claude, opening his eyes in surprise.
“They said something to me, and I tried my
best to defend Uncle Preston. They got their
money right along every month, and were not
worked any harder than the rest of us. But
how are they going to catch us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are plenty of ways in which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">Page&nbsp;240</span>
can be done,” said Mr. Preston. “They are
among the Sioux now, and it will be easy
work to get a few of the young braves to come
here and steal some cattle.”</p>

<p>“Why, they are at peace!” said Claude.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference. The Sioux are
getting mighty uneasy about their money and
their supplies, which ought to have been delivered
long ago; and when a man gets hungry
it don’t take him long to get on a cattle-stealing
expedition. They will leave you
here, wherever they find you, but they will
capture Carl.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preston laughed when he said this, and
Claude was half inclined to believe that he did
not put any faith in what the squawmen intended
to do. Carl came in very shortly, and
he, too, laughed over the story. He did not believe
that the Sioux would go on the warpath
for the sake of capturing him, and he said so.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what to do, Claude,” said he.
“If you see an Indian coming toward you,
just halt him.”</p>

<p>“How will I do that? He speaks his own
language——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">Page&nbsp;241</span></p>

<p>“Yes; but you have a rifle. Just point
that toward him, and you will see him turn
and go the other way.”</p>

<p>There was one thing that made Claude determine
that he would not stay in that country
any longer than he could help, and that was
the idea of killing him on sight. Another
thing that made him angry was the cordial
manner in which the foreman and cook, who
were not long in finding out why they came
there, greeted the newcomers. Thompson
told them that they were the very men he
needed. Claude waited some time for the
men to mount their horses and go away, and
then he approached his uncle, who was sitting
on the porch enjoying his after-dinner pipe.</p>

<p>“Why, Claude, how does this come?”
asked Mr. Preston. “You ought to have
been away long ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I wanted to see you first,” said
Claude. “I am getting sick of staying in
this country——”</p>

<p>“Ah! You don’t like the idea of the
Sioux being down on you,” said his uncle
with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">Page&nbsp;242</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about that. I have
been discontented here for a long time, and I
am impatient to get back to the city. Give
me some money and let me go.”</p>

<p>“We are very busy just now, Claude, and I
don’t know whether I can find anybody to
show you the way to Standing Rock Agency
or not. If you can wait two or three weeks I
will send somebody with you.”</p>

<p>Claude waited for him to say something
about a reward for breaking up that safe robbery,
but Mr. Preston did not say anything
about it. It was right on the end of Claude’s
tongue to ask him if he was going to give him
anything for that, but on the whole he concluded
that he would hold his peace.</p>

<p>“How much money have I got coming to
me?” he asked. “I know I have not got
much,” he added mentally, “but that will
start me on the road.”</p>

<p>“I owe you four hundred dollars,” said
his uncle. “You know you spent money
pretty lively while you were down at the
fort. That sum can’t help you much if you
are in a big city. Your expensive habits will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">Page&nbsp;243</span>
get the better of you. What do you intend
to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I know, or did know, of a
news depot that I could buy for eight hundred
dollars, and that would support me as
well as anything. But the trouble is, I haven’t
got the eight hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“No, it takes money to make money, as I
have often heard you express it. You could
probably get that news depot for your four
hundred dollars down, and if you were economical——”</p>

<p>“No, I could not. The man must have
cash, for he intends to leave the country.”</p>

<p>“That is bad, and you will have to hit upon
something else. Have you ever tried book-keeping?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. That is altogether too confining
a business for me. I want to have something
to do so that I can get out of doors once in a
while. A person would die for the want of
exercise.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what you will go at,”
said his uncle, looking down at the floor.
“Book-keeping is a very nice business, and if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">Page&nbsp;244</span>
you are careful to save your money it will last
you until you take a full course at some commercial
college.”</p>

<p>“I shall not try book-keeping, and that is
out of the question.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your father prepare you for any
business in life?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He had always got through his
life without being educated for any business,
and he thought that I could do the same.”</p>

<p>“Your father made a bad mistake—I will
say that much for him.”</p>

<p>“Have you educated Carl for any business?”
asked Claude, who kept growing angrier the
longer the conversation continued.</p>

<p>“Yes; he will be able to attend to the
stock business after I am gone. I had hoped
to prepare you for the same business, but I see
you don’t like it. If you will wait two or
three weeks I will send some one down to
show you the way to the fort,” said Mr. Preston,
getting upon his feet.</p>

<p>This was a hint that his uncle had said all
he wanted to say on the subject, and Claude at
once started out after his horse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">Page&nbsp;245</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX. <br />A New Plan.</h2>

<p>Claude was so angry when he left his
chair and started out to get his horse
that it was all he could do to keep from yelling.
He had had a short talk with his uncle,
and it amounted to nothing. The story about
finding a news depot which he could have for
eight hundred dollars was made up out of his
own head. All he wanted was to get the
money in his hands, and then he could live as
he pleased.</p>

<p>“I see it is all up with me,” said Claude, as
he mounted his horse and set out for the
range. “He does not intend to give me anything.
I have risked my life for him all these
years—I would like to know if I did not risk
my life that time the cow charged upon me
when I pulled her out of the mud—and have
kept his safe from being robbed; and all he
means to do is to fit me for a cowman! But
I guess I won’t say anything about going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">Page&nbsp;246</span>
home just now. Uncle Preston can’t last forever,
the remedies he is using don’t help his
cough one particle, and who knows but I may
get Carl to divide the business with me? I
tell you that is worth thinking of.”</p>

<p>The days passed on, and when two weeks
had gone by the young cattle had all been
branded and the cowboys had a little more
leisure on their hands. At the end of that
time his uncle called him into the office and
had his money all laid out for him.</p>

<p>“Now, Claude, if you are resolved to go, I
can send somebody to show you the way to
the fort,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, uncle, I have had plenty of opportunity
to think the matter over, and have
come to the conclusion that I will not go home
yet awhile,” replied Claude. “This is the
best business I can think of, and with your
permission I will follow it a little while longer.
Four hundred dollars, as you say, would not
help me to go into anything by which I could
support myself in the city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will keep you, and be glad
to,” his uncle hastened to answer. “And if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">Page&nbsp;247</span>
you keep on, Carl will give you a thousand
dollars to enable you to start right.”</p>

<p>“That is better than nothing,” soliloquized
Claude. “I hope you will rest easy after giving
me that small pittance out of your unbounded
wealth.” Then aloud he said: “You
say that Carl will give me that amount. What
is the reason <em>you</em> can’t give it?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t expect to last very long,”
said Mr. Preston. “In six months from now
I expect to be under the sod.”</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, don’t talk that way,” exclaimed
Claude, who for once in his life felt really
alarmed for his relative.</p>

<p>“There is no use in denying it. I feel that
I am growing weaker every day. Well, I
guess that is all I have to say to you. If
you are going to stay with me, I will put this
back in the safe.”</p>

<p>Claude was always angry after holding these
talks with his uncle. He went out of the door
respectfully enough, and, making sure that
there was no one in the hall to observe his
movements, he turned and shook his fist at it,
at the same time muttering something under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">Page&nbsp;248</span>
his breath which sounded very much like an
oath.</p>

<p>During the days that followed it was seen
by everybody that Mr. Preston was gradually
giving up to the dread disease, consumption,
which had so long threatened him. His
cough got so bad that he was finally obliged
to give up riding entirely, and remained on
his porch while his men were out herding
cattle. When Carl saw this he gave up all
hope and stayed behind with him; but affection
could not curb the fell destroyer. At
last Mr. Preston took to his bed, from which
he never got up. The men came on tiptoe to
his room to inquire after him, and even Claude
felt awed in the presence of death. That is,
he tried to appear so before the men; but
when he got on his horse, away from everybody,
he could scarcely restrain himself.</p>

<p>“He must have made a will,” said Claude.
“No person ever died with such an amount
of property on hand without doing so. Who
knows but that he has left me something? I
will not wait for that thousand dollars. Carl
can keep it and welcome—that is, if he thinks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">Page&nbsp;249</span>
he cannot get along without it. I’ll take what
is coming to me and go to the city, provided
I cannot get around Carl and get him to divide
the business with me. That is my only hope
now.”</p>

<p>At last it was all over. When Claude came
in from the range one day something told him
that “the meanest man he ever saw” was out
of his way for all time to come. Carl had
shut himself up in his room, but Claude soon
found his way into the death-chamber, where
he stayed just one minute, and then came out.
The three herdsmen who had gone off to engage
in business on their own responsibility
were there, and also several officers from the
fort; for Mr. Preston was popular, and his
friends believed in showing him all the respect
in their power.</p>

<p>Two days passed, and then all that was
mortal of Mr. Preston was laid away in a grave
which he had selected for his eternal abiding-place.
Then the mourners returned to the
house to witness the reading of the will. The
doctor took charge of the matter, and, beginning
with the foreman, he read all through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">Page&nbsp;250</span>
until he came to Carl, to whom he bequeathed
all his property left over after the legacies had
been provided for. To each man he left one
thousand dollars, and Claude’s name had not
been mentioned at all. That young gentleman
was surprised and thunderstruck; and all
this while the doctor had been folding down
the will to get at a short codicil there was
at the bottom of it. He read it when he came
to it, and even in death he found that his uncle
was still giving him advice. He bequeathed
to Claude the sum of one thousand dollars,
and wound up with the hope that Claude would
save his money, and that it would be the means
of leading him to prosperity and success. The
amount was so much smaller than Claude
thought it was going to be, that for a moment
or two he hardly seemed to breathe; but he
finally came to himself, and taking up his hat,
which lay beside him on the floor, he walked
out of the house. He held in pretty well until
he was behind the stables, out of sight, and
then gave full vent to his feelings.</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars!” said he, and this
time he did not try to interrupt the oaths that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">Page&nbsp;251</span>
came out thick and fast. “And I saved his
safe from being robbed, too. I must try Carl
now, although he is so awful stingy I don’t
think I can make anything out of him. If
I once get a drove of cattle to sell I will skip
out with the first money I get.”</p>

<p>For a long time Claude did not go into the
house. He felt enraged at his uncle, and he
knew it showed itself in his face; but after a
while he managed to go in in time for supper.
The officers at the fort had gone away, and
there was no one left except the three men who
had gone off herding cattle for themselves.
When he got there he found that something
of moment was being discussed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I shall act,” said Thompson,
looking down at his plate. “I never have
been in the city in my life.”</p>

<p>“You can do just as I do,” answered Carl.
“I never have been in the city but a few times
in my life, and I shall stay there no longer
than I can help. There are some men in St.
Louis who ought to be in jail, and if they
found out that we had that amount of money
with us they would try to steal it. You will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">Page&nbsp;252</span>
go with us, won’t you?” he added, turning to his
cousin, who at that moment came in. “Father
has given by his will ten thousand dollars that
I have not got, and I shall have to go to St.
Louis after it. Thompson don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>Claude did not say anything immediately,
for the words brought a new plan into his
head. If he was going to St. Louis after more
money, what was the reason he could not get
that money for himself? He knew some pretty
rough characters in St. Louis, more’s the pity,
and it would be no trouble at all to induce them
to waylay Carl in some manner and get that
money from him. But there was Thompson,
who didn’t want to go. He would go armed,
of course—he could not go anywhere without
his revolvers were strapped around him—and
he would be in the way. If he could only
think of some method to induce his cousin to
leave Thompson behind. Seeing that Carl’s
eyes were fastened on him with an inquiring
look, Claude answered the question.</p>

<p>“Of course I will go with you, for St. Louis
is the place I want to see,” said he. “If
Thompson would rather stay here——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">Page&nbsp;253</span></p>

<p>“But he isn’t going to stay here,” Carl
hastened to reply. “I have given my orders,
which are for him to be ready to start for the
city to-morrow. He will be ready, of course.
I will pay you your thousand dollars after we
get there.”</p>

<p>This put a stop to further conversation on
the subject, for everybody saw that Carl had
made up his mind and that all argument was
useless. When supper was ended Claude
went out on the porch and sat down with his
cousin.</p>

<p>“If I was in your place I would leave
Thompson at home,” said he. “He will be
out of place there among all those nice people,
and he won’t be of any use to you, either.”</p>

<p>“I will risk that,” said Carl. “I want
somebody along who is not afraid to shoot if
I get into trouble, and Thompson is the only
one I know of.”</p>

<p>His cousin was firmly set upon this point,
and Claude did not think it best to pursue the
subject any further. He now came to the
matter that was uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>“Did Uncle Preston say anything to you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">Page&nbsp;254</span>
about dividing this business with me?” he
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” said Carl in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Well, he said something to me about it,
and I supposed you had got your instructions
from him.”</p>

<p>“He never said a thing about it. He left
the whole business in my charge. He told
me, however, that if you stayed here until you
are able to herd cattle for yourself I was to
give you a thousand dollars to help you along.”</p>

<p>“I confess that that is a surprise to me,”
said Claude, as if he were almost overwhelmed
with astonishment. “I supposed that he was
going to provide for me during my lifetime.”</p>

<p>Carl was really amazed to hear this. Of
one thing he was sure: If his father had said
anything to him about taking Claude into
partnership with him, he would have done it,
although he would have rebelled against it.
But Claude did not know anything about
herding cattle. He would have felt as safe by
taking some tenderfoot out of an office in a
city, who had never seen cattle on a stampede,
and giving him a half interest in his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">Page&nbsp;255</span></p>

<p>“I had but a little over four hundred dollars
coming to me, and he said that amount
was not enough to set me going till I could
support myself,” said Claude, leaning his
elbows on his knees and gazing thoughtfully
at the floor. “I don’t know what I shall do
now.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> don’t know, I am sure. I shall carry
out the terms of his will, and more than that
I cannot do.”</p>

<p>“You are willing to leave me to starve, I
suppose?” said Claude, allowing his rage to
get the better of him.</p>

<p>“If fifteen hundred dollars won’t keep you
till you can find something to do, you ought
to starve.”</p>

<p>During all the months that Claude had
been with his cousin, living under the same
roof with him, and seeing him in no end of
scrapes with wild horses and wilder cattle, he
had never seen him exhibit so much spirit
before. He started up in his chair and looked
at Claude as if waiting for him to say something
else. Claude returned his gaze, and
then picked up his hat and walked away; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">Page&nbsp;256</span>
the moment he got behind the stables he
straightened up and shook both his fists in the
direction of the porch.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that boy had so much
pluck,” said Claude. “No matter which way
I turn, I am to be left out in the cold. Never
mind. I’ve seen worse men than Thompson
got away with, and we’ll see whether or not
he gets away with all the money.”</p>

<p>“The idea of my dividing this business with
him,” said Carl in disgust. “Father never
said a word about it. I would feel a great
deal safer if I had Thompson. But I don’t
intend to stay around here after I get back
from St. Louis. I don’t want to be here,
where everything will remind me of father.
I shall go down to the fort and hire out to the
commandant for a scout. I know the country
as well as anybody, and I will not get lost.”</p>

<p>Carl’s first care was to get himself ready for
the journey that was to come off on the morrow.
He had been in the city but a few times with
his father, and he thought he was pretty well
acquainted with the banker who had charge
of his father’s money; but in order to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">Page&nbsp;257</span>
assurance doubly sure there was a letter in his
sire’s will addressed to the gentleman in question,
and he was sure that it would gain him
the identification necessary for him to get the
funds. This letter he put carefully away in
the inside pocket of the moleskin suit which
he laid out in readiness for the trip. Thompson
came in after he had set the men to work
and seated himself on Carl’s bed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">Page&nbsp;258</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI. <br />The Trip to St. Louis.</h2>

<p>“Well, Thompson, what do think of the
situation?” asked Carl, after waiting
for some time to hear what the foreman had
on his mind.</p>

<p>“I hain’t got nothing to wear,” said Thompson.</p>

<p>“You have as much as I have,” replied
Carl.</p>

<p>“Everybody will look at us as we go tramping
along the streets, and they will think we
came from the hills, sure enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, you do, don’t you?” said Carl with
a smile. “They looked at me the same way
too, when I first went there, but I didn’t care
for that. We will stay there one night and
come away the next day. You can surely
stand it that long.”</p>

<p>Yes, Thompson thought that he could do that, and
adjourned to his own room to give <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_259">Page&nbsp;259</span> his clothes the needed brushing.
They would do well enough out there where everybody wore clothing
of the same description, but he did not know how they would look in
a place containing so large a population as St. Louis. He concluded
that everything would pass muster except his <span lang="es"
xml:lang="es">chaparejos</span>, his cowboy’s riding-pants, which he
thought were a little too well-worn to pass muster anywhere. But then
he could exchange with one of the new men whom Mr. Preston had hired a
short time before his death.</p>

<p>“I declare, they look shabby,” said the
foreman, standing off with his brush and giving
his clothes a good looking over. “Well,
I would like to see anybody who has been out
here as long as I have, go there looking any
better. If it were not for such fellows as me,
some of them would go hungry for their beef.”</p>

<p>Claude came in shortly after that and began
to pack his trunk. Now, that trunk was the
source of a great deal of annoyance to Carl.
If it had not been for that they could have
gone on horseback, and thus completed their
journey in half the time. As it was, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">Page&nbsp;260</span>
were obliged to take a wagon with them, and
that would delay them just four days.</p>

<p>“At any rate I shall see the last of you,”
soliloquized Carl, as he passed along the hall
and saw Claude at work with his trunk. “I
wish you had never come here. I know
Thompson will be glad that you are gone.”</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Carl really
disliked his cousin, for he did not; but at the
same time candor compelled him to say that
affairs about the ranch did not move as
smoothly as they did before he came there.
He seemed to possess the faculty of getting the
cowboys into a turmoil. Every little thing
that was said out on the range went straight
to his father’s ears, until Mr. Preston told him
that his cowboys satisfied him, and he didn’t
want to have any more stories brought to him.
Thompson was the one who had the most fault
to find with him. If he started him off to find
certain cattle that had strayed off the range,
he would perhaps find him, in an hour or two,
miles away from his post, stretched out beneath
the shade of a tree and taking matters easy.
At such a time Thompson always gave him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">Page&nbsp;261</span>
the full benefit of his tongue, and it seemed to
be hung in the middle, so that he could keep
both ends of it clattering at once.</p>

<p>“There is one thing that I forgot to speak
to you about,” said Carl, going into Thompson’s
room. “Do you suppose that father
ever said a word about my taking Claude into
partnership with me?”</p>

<p>Thompson looked at Carl, and then backed
toward the nearest chair and dropped into it.</p>

<p>“Claude told me of that this morning,”
continued Carl. “He says he don’t know
what he shall do to support himself if I let
him go home.”</p>

<p>“How much money has he got coming to
him?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p>“Counting in the thousand, he has fifteen
hundred dollars. At any rate, that is what I
shall pay him.”</p>

<p>“He can certainly get something to do before
that is gone. If he can’t, he ought to go
hungry.”</p>

<p>“That is what I told him. Do you suppose
father said a word to him about going into
partnership with me?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">Page&nbsp;262</span></p>
<p>“No,” said Thompson emphatically. “I
will tell you what is a fact, Carl. I love the
ranch, I love every horse and cow on it, but
if you take that man into business with you,
you can get another foreman.”</p>

<p>“You need not worry yourself. I have no
intention of doing it.”</p>

<p>The next morning the cowboys were all up
at four o’clock to see the journey begun. If
good wishes could have anything to do with
them, they would certainly get back in as fine
order as they were when they started. Claude’s
trunk had been thrown into the wagon without
much regard to consequences, much to
that young gentleman’s disgust, and in ten
minutes more the ranch was out of sight.
They stopped that night at the fort, and if we
were to say that everybody was glad to see
Carl we should be touching the matter very
lightly. Everybody had something to say
about the loss of his father, and the kind
words brought tears to Carl’s eyes. He got
away from the officers and went to see the
commandant of the fort. He wanted to get a
position for himself as bad as Claude did.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">Page&nbsp;263</span>
The colonel just listened to him until he found
out what he had come there for, and then got
up and shook him by the hand.</p>

<p>“Of course I have got a position for you,”
said he. “You want to hurry back from St.
Louis and get here as soon as possible. I will
have business for you every day.”</p>

<p>Thompson was not at all pleased to hear
this. Of course he would be given charge of
the ranch during his employer’s absence, but
that did not suit him. He wanted Carl around
so that he could take orders from him, and the
place would be lonely without him. Claude,
too, looked glum when he heard of it.</p>

<p>“You seem to find something to do without
going out of your own country,” said he with
evident disgust, “and I have got to go to St.
Louis, and probably will not find anything
there to suit me.”</p>

<p>Carl did not know what reply to make to
this, so he said nothing. The next day they
started on again, and in four days arrived at
Standing Rock Agency. They made arrangements
with the teamsters to keep their mules
until they came back, and then Carl found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">Page&nbsp;264</span>
the quartermaster, of whom they obtained a
permit to go down to Fort Scully on his boat.
It was a small boat, built to run when the
water in the river was shallow, and the time
they had in getting down to their journey’s
end filled Carl with impatience. There seemed
to be a bar in every bend, and the boat was
kept busy “sparring off” to enable her to continue
on her way; but at length Fort Scully
was sighted and the boat made her landing.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect we will be here when you
come back,” said the captain, to whom Carl
had gone for some information on the subject.
“We shall probably be up at Standing Rock
Agency; but if we are not here, you can wait.”</p>

<p>This was bad news for Carl, who wanted to
get through with the trip and get back to his
ranch without loss of time. He found another
boat that was going to St. Louis, and on her
he took passage, and after a pleasant journey—there
was not as much “sparring off” to do on
this boat as there was on the quartermaster’s—they
reached their destination. Thompson
now had some fault to find with the men, and
women, too, whom he met on this journey. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">Page&nbsp;265</span>
good many of them gazed in surprise at his
long hair, his wide sombrero and the clothing
he wore, and he came to Carl and complained
about it.</p>

<p>“I told you just how it would be,” said he.
“The folks all think I don’t belong here.”</p>

<p>“Do just as I do; pay no attention to
them,” said Carl. “You have only got to
stand it for a little while. We will soon be
on our way back again.”</p>

<p>One morning when Carl awoke and raised
himself on his elbow he found that the boat
was tied up to the levee. He arose and went
to the door, and could see nothing but boats
on either side of him. Thompson slept in the
bunk above him, and it was the work of but a
few minutes to arouse him. Claude, we ought
to say, did not approve of this arrangement at
all. He thought he ought to occupy the same
state-room with his cousin, but he was put
into a room with an entire stranger. He first
muttered gloomy threats over it, and then
tried to think up the men he would get to
assist him in waylaying Carl and getting his
ten thousand dollars out of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">Page&nbsp;266</span></p>

<p>“You think you are bothering me by paying
so much attention to that miserable foreman,”
said he. “Wait till we get to the city
and you are given charge of that money. If
Thompson is not afraid to shoot, I will get
somebody who isn’t afraid either.”</p>

<p>“Thompson, wake up!” said Carl, when he
had satisfied himself that he was at his journey’s
end. “This boat got here and we
never knew it. Now, we will stay on board
and get our breakfast, and in the meantime I
will see the captain and find out at what hour
this boat will start up the river again. When
nine o’clock comes we’ll go up to the bank.”</p>

<p>“Here you are,” exclaimed Claude, as they
opened the door and stepped into the cabin.
“You come with me, and I will take you where
you can get a breakfast that will do you good.
I am tired of living on these steamboats.”</p>

<p>“Where is the captain?” asked Carl.
“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“He is around here somewhere. What do
you want to see him for?”</p>

<p>“We want to find out when this boat is going
to start again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">Page&nbsp;267</span></p>

<p>“Are you going back so soon?” inquired
Claude. “Why, you haven’t seen any fun at
all. You want to go to the theatre——”</p>

<p>“We did not come out to see fun on this
trip,” said Carl. “We came out on business;
and when that is done we are going back.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is no way to do,” said Claude,
somewhat alarmed. He wanted to see two of
his boon companions by the time that Carl
thought of going back, and if he was going to
start up the river that night or to-morrow
morning, he would be pressed for time. “You
showed me all there was to be seen about your
ranch, and you must let me do the same. I
am acquainted here in St. Louis——”</p>

<p>“There’s the captain now,” interrupted
Carl. “Come on, Thompson. Let us go and
see him.”</p>

<p>Claude was angry, as he always was whenever
he had anything important to say to his
cousin, and stood there and watched them
while they hurried forward to interview the
captain. Carl made known his wants in a
few words, and the skipper said:</p>

<p>“We shall start out to-morrow night, if we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">Page&nbsp;268</span>
can get loaded. Is there any boat that will
start before this one? I don’t know, but you
can look around and see. If you don’t find
any, come aboard of us.”</p>

<p>Claude loafed about just long enough to
hear the captain say this, and then turned and
walked out on the guards.</p>

<p>“If I only had my money in my pockets I
would go and hunt up those men the first
thing I do,” said he. “It is ‘Thompson, do
this,’ or ‘Thompson, do that,’ and ‘Claude,
you can go to smash,’ until I have grown sick
and tired of hearing it. I bet you that I will
get the start of them yet.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before breakfast was
ready, and Claude remained alone on the
guards, as Carl and Thompson were perfectly
willing he should do. They were sitting on
the forward part of the boiler deck engaged in
conversation, and when the breakfast-bell rang
they went into the cabin. Only once during the
meal hour did Carl address his cousin, and then
it was to the effect that they would go up town
as soon as the bank opened, and he would be
glad to have his cousin go with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">Page&nbsp;269</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Morphy will give you your own
money with his own hands, and then you will
know that you have got it right,” said he in
conclusion. “He will give you fifteen hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“And that is three thousand less than I
deserve,” said Claude to himself. “If anybody
would lay their plans to rob your safe I
would not tell you of it.”</p>

<p>After breakfast there came two hours of
loafing around with nothing to do, and Carl
grew very weary over it. Thompson was
looking for somebody to make fun of his
clothes, and every time some one passed him
and turned to take a second look the foreman
would gaze angrily at them and slip his hand
into the inside pocket of his coat. Carl saw
it, and it was all he could do to keep from
laughing in Thompson’s face; but at length
the hands on his watch told him that the hour
had come, and he jumped up, uttering the
order he had so long been used to—</p>

<p>“Catch up!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">Page&nbsp;270</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII. <br />A Surprise.</h2>

<p>When they got ashore they found themselves
surrounded by the sights and
sounds of the city, and they were so taken up
with them that they could not say much to
each other. Thompson kept close at Carl’s
side all the way, for he was afraid that if he
became separated from him he would get lost
among the drays and pedestrians. Carl knew
right where he was going, and in process of
time reached the bank. He entered as though
he had a perfect right there, and once on the
inside he found himself confronted by a long
line of men who had come there on business—brokers’
clerks who had come there to get
their boxes, and others to get their checks
cashed—and, standing his friends up against
a desk, fell into the rear and patiently waited
until his turn came. Then he handed out the
letter he had found in his father’s will and inquired
if Mr. Morphy was anywhere about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">Page&nbsp;271</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the cashier. “He is in
his private office.”</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to send that
letter in to him?” said Carl; and then he left
the line and took his stand beside his companions.
“When he comes out and asks me in I
want you to go with me,” he said to them in
a low tone.</p>

<p>Carl saw the clerk who had the letter in
his possession vanish through a rear door, and
while he was thinking about it Mr. Morphy
came out. He glanced hastily at the men,
and then advanced and took Carl by the
hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Preston,” said
he, with a touch of sadness in his tones. “I
am sorry that your father is not here with
you. Come into the office.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to ask these men to go also,”
said Carl.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Bring them right along.”</p>

<p>When he got into the office he put out
chairs for them, but every thing was so neat
and elegant that Thompson did not want to
sit down; but he kept a close watch of Carl,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">Page&nbsp;272</span>
and seeing that the latter promptly seated
himself, he finally followed his example.</p>

<p>“I have not read your father’s letter yet,”
said the president, “and if you will excuse
me I will do it now. I have only read that
he is dead, but I can hardly realize it. Did
he die suddenly?”</p>

<p>“It was sudden enough when it came, but
I suppose he lingered along as all men do who
are suffering from that disease,” answered
Carl. “It seems he thought that the letter
would tell who I was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I would have known you anyway.
If I see a man’s face once, I can always remember
him.”</p>

<p>The president then went on reading the
letter, and when he got through he was ready
for business.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want some money,” he said
briskly. “Make out a check for what you
want and you can have it.”</p>

<p>Carl took the paper and the pen that were
passed over to him and speedily made out his
check for ten thousand dollars. The president
looked at it to make sure that it was all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">Page&nbsp;273</span>
right, and went into the room where the cashier
was. When he came out he had a big roll of
bills in his hands.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to pay the terms of
the will with this, and so I have got it in
small bills,” said he.</p>

<p>“That is all right,” said Carl. “Thank
you, I don’t want to go over it. I wish you
would count out fifteen hundred dollars and
give it to my cousin here, Claude Preston.
He comes in for one share.”</p>

<p>The president complied, and when Claude
had taken the money (he never said “Thank
you!” for it, either) Carl turned to Thompson.</p>

<p>“I want you to make room about your
clothes to stow this money in,” said he.
“Then I shall feel safe.”</p>

<p>Thompson, without saying a word, got upon
his feet, and thrusting his hands one after the
other into the inside pockets of his coat,
brought out two big navy revolvers, which he
laid upon the desk. Mr. Morphy looked on
with surprise and remarked that Carl intended
to have his money defended, at any rate.</p>

<p>“Yes; the people here in St. Louis are all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">Page&nbsp;274</span>
strangers to me, and I shall feel a good deal
safer when I get back to my ranch,” said
Carl, rising to his feet. “One does not know
when he is safe.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact,” said Mr. Morphy; “and
let me tell you one thing right here: Don’t
make any friends at all. If a man comes to
you and appears cordial and inquires after
your health, go away from him and let him
entirely alone. He is friendly to your money,
but he is not at all friendly to you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bear that in mind,” said Carl, for he
was not very well posted in regard to all the
tricks that sharpers make use of to trap innocent
victims. “We thank you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morphy bowed, accompanied them to
the front door, and saw them start toward their
boat. Claude said nothing at all, for he was
almost overwhelmed by the sight of the eight
thousand dollars that Thompson had in his
bosom. He saw that his shirt stuck out until
a person would think he was wonderfully developed
about the chest. He imagined how
he would feel if that money was his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">Page&nbsp;275</span></p>

<p>“I wish I had some place to carry these
revolvers,” said the foreman anxiously. “I
have got to carry them in my hip pockets,
and every one who comes up behind me can
see them.”</p>

<p>“That shows that you are ready to defend
what you have in your shirt,” said Carl with
a laugh. “But that is all in your favor.
There is a law against carrying concealed
weapons, but yours are not concealed. Every
one who looks at you knows that you have
them.”</p>

<p>At this moment, as if to show that Carl was
right in his surmises, a policeman came along,
and after taking a look at Thompson, turned
and gave him another look as he passed. He
saw the butts of the navy revolvers sticking
out of his pockets, and then smiled at Carl
and passed on as if he thought it was all right.</p>

<p>“There, Thompson, that cop saw your pistols
and never said a word to you,” said he.</p>

<p>“What cop?” asked Thompson in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, that policeman. Your revolvers
are not concealed, and so he took no notice
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">Page&nbsp;276</span></p>

<p>“Then I am all right,” said the foreman,
immensely relieved. “I supposed that he
would arrest me for having those weapons
about me. Oh, yes, I am all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, here is your boat, and I presume
you will go aboard of her,” said Claude,
as they arrived upon the levee. “I believe I
will take leave of you right here.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with that
money you have in your pocket?” asked
Carl. “You ought to put it in the bank,
where it will be safe.”</p>

<p>“I will attend to that the first thing I do.
I will bet you that nobody will get it out of
me. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Thompson drew a long breath of relief,
while Carl held out his hand to his cousin.
He did not say that he was sorry to have him
go away where he might never see him again,
because he wasn’t. He hoped that, Claude
having got away from the ranch, things would
go on as smoothly as they had done before he
came there. But Claude, although he shook
his cousin’s hand heartily, was not yet done
with him by any means. He had his eye on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">Page&nbsp;277</span>
that wad of money that Thompson carried in
his shirt, and he did not intend to see the last
of Carl until he had the handling of some of it.</p>

<p>“If you are going away before I have time
to show you some of the sights of the city, I
don’t know but I might as well bid you good-by
now as some other time,” said Claude, drawing
his left hand hastily across his eyes. “You
have been mighty good to me since I have
been out there on the ranch with you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is all right,” said Carl, who did
not care to listen to any words which he knew
Claude did not mean. “We treated you as we
would anybody else who came there, and no
better. Good-by, and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>When Claude had taken leave of his cousin
he turned to say a word to Thompson, but
that fellow had put his hands behind him.
He was not going to take leave of him as Carl
had done. Claude saw in a moment that he
could not say anything to the foreman, so he
turned on his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>“I am surprised at you,” said Carl, when
Claude had passed on out of hearing. “Were
you not sorry to see him go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">Page&nbsp;278</span></p>

<p>“No, I was not,” said Thompson emphatically.
“I have been in constant hot water
ever since he has been on the ranch. I told
you at the start that I did not think you would
like Claude, and I hit it, did I not?”</p>

<p>“You put your hands behind you because
you did not want to bid me good-by, did you?”
said Claude, turning about in his walk to grit
his teeth at the foreman. “Well, I will bet
you that before night you cannot shake hands
with anybody. I will get a couple of men
after you who will leave you in the river.”</p>

<p>Carl did not intend to go on board his old
vessel until he had been the length of the
levee and had satisfied himself that there was
no boat getting ready to sail before she did.
It was not necessary that he should go on
every one he saw to make inquiries. Some
of them had their destinations printed on
canvas and hung up on their hurricane-deck
railings—for example, “For Vicksburg,”
“For Cairo,” and for “New Orleans”—but
he had yet to see one that was to sail up the
river.</p>

<p>“I guess we had better go aboard our old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">Page&nbsp;279</span>
boat and take our chances,” said Carl, after he
had grown weary of examining the steamers.
“Those officers are like old friends to us, and
somehow I feel safer in their presence than I
would anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“That is what I say,” answered Thompson.
“If I was back at the ranch I tell you you
would have to get somebody else to come with
you.”</p>

<p>Carl laughed and led the way aboard their
own boat, where they secured a couple of
chairs and sat down to wait until the steamer
was ready to sail. They had already left their
luggage (each one of them had a valise) in
the hands of the porter, and when they saw
the clerk go into his office Carl thought he
would pay his passage and get a better room
than they had in coming down. Thompson
kept close at his side wherever he went. The
presence of so large an amount of money made
him terribly uneasy, and he did not want to
let Carl out of his sight.</p>

<p>“You are going back with us,” said the
clerk, after Carl had told him the object of
his visit. “We will go up to-morrow, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">Page&nbsp;280</span>
she will be the first one out. We are to take
on some army rations for those fellows at Fort
Scully, and it won’t be any trouble at all for
you to wait three or four days until that little
boat comes down. Five dollars, please.”</p>

<p>“But you see we don’t want to wait,” said
Carl, pulling out his ten dollars. “We are
impatient to get back to our ranch as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were ranchmen the first
time I saw you,” said the clerk. “You have
lively times out there with the bears and
mountain lions and all the other things. Do
you live far from the river?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a good piece. You see we are
not used to the ways of the city, and when we
get out there we are at home.”</p>

<p>Their passage was soon paid, their valises
secured from the porter and placed in their
new room, and the two went back to their
chairs on the boiler deck. When the bell
rang for dinner they went in, and scarcely had
they seated themselves in their chairs again
when they discovered two men coming up the
stairs. They were both well dressed and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">Page&nbsp;281</span>
evidently going somewhere on business, for
they had valises in their hands. They looked
all around as if searching for somebody, and
then one of them ventured to address Carl.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell
me when this boat sails?” said he, politely.</p>

<p>Remembering what Mr. Morphy had said
to him in regard to making friends with
strangers, Carl did not act as he usually did
when he was approached by persons with
whom he was not acquainted. He looked up
and simply said.</p>

<p>“You will find the clerk in his office.”</p>

<p>“So he is,” said the man. “So he is. Come
on, Bob, and we’ll soon see how much it is
going to cost us to go up to Fort Scully.”</p>

<p>“There are a couple of men that we want
to keep out of the way of,” said Carl, gazing
after the passengers as they walked into the
cabin. “They are going up our way, but we
will not make friends with them, or with anybody
else.”</p>

<p>“Why, I took that man for a gentleman,”
said Thompson. “He begged your pardon
before he spoke to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">Page&nbsp;282</span></p>

<p>“That may be; but some of the biggest
rascals there are agoing can be gentlemen
when they please.”</p>

<p>Thompson believed the boy to be mistaken,
although he tried to be governed by him in
all his movements. He saw the men pay their
fare, and then one walked off toward the
farther end of the cabin, while the other came
out and took a chair on the boiler deck. He
cast a quick searching glance at both of them
(Thompson thought he knew what he had in
his bosom to make his shirt stick out that
way), and then drew back and placed his feet
on the railing.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness I have my fare paid to
my journey’s end,” said the man. “Have
you been up the river lately?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days ago,” said Carl shortly.</p>

<p>“Is there much water up there?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“The reason I am so anxious in inquiring
is that I have wasted a week in my trip up
here, and am impatient to get to Fort Scully
to see about some property I have there. Are
you acquainted in Fort Scully?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">Page&nbsp;283</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know that I am,” replied Carl,
and then he arose to his feet and went into
the cabin, closing the door after him; but he
was not in time to shut out Thompson, who
stuck close to him. The cabin was entirely
deserted, and the two men were in no danger
of being overheard.</p>

<p>“Did you notice what that man said about
his property?” asked Carl. “If I had inquired
into it, I should have found that he
had a check on some bank to a large amount,
and he would want to borrow some money on
it. I declare that man is coming in. Let us
go to our own room.”</p>

<p>If the man was going to follow them up,
he opened the cabin just in time to see the
door of their state-room close behind them;
but when they got there, Carl, who was leading
the way, suddenly stopped. They had
taken particular notice of the way they left
their valises when they brought them there.
They had put them under the lower bunk, out
of the way; but here they were in the middle
of the room, and the contents of each were
scattered all over the floor. In addition to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">Page&nbsp;284</span>
this, the outside door, which opened onto the
guards, was closed but not fastened. In two
jumps Carl reached the door, pulled it open,
and looked up and down the guards; but
there was no one in sight.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII. <br />Claude Visits the Pool-room.</h2>

<p>“You treated me just as you treat everybody
else who came to your ranch,
and no better,” said Claude, hurrying down
the street, away from his cousin. “You
couldn’t treat me any better than you could
anybody else just because I was a relation of
yours, could you? Well, you gave me one
piece of advice that I will remember. I will
put this money in bank, so that the fellows
can’t draw on me for it.”</p>

<p>Claude was so mad when he took leave of
his cousin that he tore along the street, paying
no attention to anybody, bumping against
the pedestrians he chanced to meet, and then
hurried on without apologizing and presently
reached the bank where his father had kept a
small amount deposited during his lifetime.
Here he left fourteen hundred dollars of his
money, and with the balance tucked safely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">Page&nbsp;286</span>
away in his vest pocket he came out and took
his way toward a pool-room which he had
often been in the habit of visiting. He had
been away from St. Louis a long time, and he
was not certain that he could find anyone
there with whom he was acquainted. The
length of time he had been away, gaining
health and strength by his outdoor exercise,
had doubtless scattered the old frequenters of
the place far and wide, and he would not
know where to go to look for them.</p>

<p>“It all depends upon finding two men here
who will just ache to handle that—I believe
I’ll put it twenty thousand while I am about
it,” said Claude, as he turned and made his
way up stairs to the pool-room. “Ten thousand
might not tempt them to run any risk,
so I guess I will just double it. The first
thing I do must be to keep myself out of
Carl’s way. I will show the fellows where
the boat lies, and they must do the rest.”</p>

<p>Claude threw open a door as he spoke, and
there was the pool-room in full blast. There
were four tables in the room, and each of
them was surrounded by men and boys who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">Page&nbsp;287</span>
were eagerly watching the game. No one
noticed him when he went in. There was a
new barkeeper behind the counter, and a
hasty glance at the men about the tables satisfied
him that the ones he wanted to see were
not there, or, if they were, the hours they had
passed at the pool-room had changed them
materially.</p>

<p>“Is Tony Waller here yet?” said he, addressing
the barkeeper.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not,” said the man, with a
laugh. “Tony’s gone up.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked Claude.</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t; but he might as well be.
Tony couldn’t make money by playing for it
honest, and so he had to go to work and hold
up one of our customers. He got five years
for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, is Bud Kelly here?” said Claude,
who was surprised to hear this about Tony.</p>

<p>“Do you see that man over there on the
last table—he is just going to shoot,” said the
barkeeper. “That’s Kelly.”</p>

<p>“My goodness! How he has changed,”
exclaimed Claude, hardly willing to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">Page&nbsp;288</span>
his eyes. “He used to be a fancy duck, and
now he looks as though he didn’t have enough
to eat.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen you around here of late,”
said the man.</p>

<p>“No; I have just come from the West.
Kelly used to have a nice position in an insurance
office.”</p>

<p>“He lost that, and he has lost every position
he has had since then. He makes his
living out of pool.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I must go and see him,”
said Claude to himself, as he walked toward
the last table where Kelly was playing. “So
Tony has gone up. I wonder if I have not
got something else under way that will send
Kelly up, too, if he is caught at it? He will
have to run that risk.”</p>

<p>Claude caught Kelly’s eyes fastened upon
him as he walked up to a chair and seated
himself where he could watch the game, but
no sign of recognition came forth. Claude
was wondering if he had changed, too, but he
could not have altered his appearance so much
as the other man. His clothes were neat and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">Page&nbsp;289</span>
whole, and that was more than could be said
of Kelly. Every once in a while the player
looked toward him, and when the game was
finished he put up his cue and came and took
a chair beside Claude.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said with an attempt at
familiarity, “I think I have seen you once
before.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, after all the long
months I have spent out West?” said Claude.</p>

<p>“Claude Preston!” exclaimed Kelly. “I
knew I had seen you, but I could not place
you.”</p>

<p>The two shook hands as though they were
overjoyed to meet each other once more, and
then Kelly settled down and pulled Claude’s
face over toward him.</p>

<p>“How did the old man pan out?” said he
in a lower tone. “Did you make anything
out of him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Claude in disgust. “He was
the meanest man I ever saw; but he has paid
for it all. He is dead.”</p>

<p>“But he left you something in his will?”
said Kelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">Page&nbsp;290</span></p>

<p>“No, he didn’t; not a thing. But I know
where there are twenty thousand dollars that
one could have for himself if he only had a
little pluck. You used to be pretty good at
such things; have you turned over a new
leaf?”</p>

<p>“Waller has gone up for trying that very
thing,” said Kelly, as if his heart was not in
the matter.</p>

<p>“But there is no such danger in this,” answered
Claude. “Now wait until I tell you
how I have left things.”</p>

<p>With this introduction, Claude went on
and told Kelly everything that had happened
to him while coming down with his cousin—how
they went to the bank and drew out
twenty thousand dollars which Thompson
stowed away in his shirt, and that they were
going back on the Talisman, the same boat
that had brought them down from Fort
Scully.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Thompson will keep the
money around him all the while,” said Claude
in conclusion. “When they get back to their
boat they are going to put it in their valise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">Page&nbsp;291</span>
If they do that, you can easily get it. Twenty
thousand dollars! That will be a little over
six thousand dollars apiece, and you can go to
California on that.”</p>

<p>“How will I know them if I see them?”
asked Kelly. The tone in which he spoke the
words made Claude more than half inclined
to believe that Kelly had a mind to try it.</p>

<p>“They are dressed in regular Western
style—long hair, broad sombreros, and boots
as fine as money can buy. They will be
aboard the boat now, and this is the time to
capture them.”</p>

<p>Some more talk followed this conversation,
and Kelly got up and went out. Claude
waited an hour for him to come back, and all
the while he was harassed by the fear that
the man Kelly had gone after might not see it
as plainly as he did.</p>

<p>“There is not a thing to do but to wait until
after dark, and then pitch in and grab the
money,” said Claude to himself. “They can
throw Carl overboard to keep him from using
his revolvers, and I know that both of them
can manage Thompson. I do hope that man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">Page&nbsp;292</span>
will agree to it. It is the best chance in the
world they will ever have to make money.”</p>

<p>By the time Claude had got through communicating
with himself in this way the door
opened and Kelly came in, followed by a man
who was evidently hard up and had been for
some time, judging by the looks of his clothes.
This man was introduced as Sam Hayward;
and, in accordance with his request, Claude was
obliged to begin his story all over again. One
thing that surprised Claude was the fact that
the man took a deep interest in it, and seemed
determined to get at it as soon as possible.
He listened to Claude all through, and when
he ceased he said:</p>

<p>“I say we can do it, Bud.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the world to hinder
it, if you only go at it with a determination
to succeed,” said Claude. “But there is one
thing you must bear in mind: Don’t let that
Thompson put his hands behind him. He is
a little quicker than a flash of lightning, and
he will shoot before you know it.”</p>

<p>“We will look out for that,” said Hayward.
“If he shoots, it shall not cost him anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">Page&nbsp;293</span></p>

<p>There was another thing that Claude wanted
to get at, and that was some better clothes than
those two men had on. They must go aboard
the steamer as though they were going up to
Fort Scully, and they must have a valise or
two, to take the appearance of travellers.
Kelly must have known what he was thinking
about, for he looked them over from top
to bottom, and he hastened to remark:</p>

<p>“If you say we can do it, why we will go and
try it on. We will go home and get on some
other clothes, and then you must go with us
to show us where the Talisman lies. But see
here, Claude—haven’t you got a little money
with you? We’re strapped, and that’s a fact.
If we are going as travellers, of course we
have got to pay our fare, and where is the
money coming from to do it?”</p>

<p>Claude had been expecting this, and he was
not in any hurry to advance the men money,
but he did not see how he could get out of it.
He was afraid he might never see it again;
but if they got the eight thousand dollars——</p>

<p>“I have got just a hundred dollars in
money that I saved from my work at herding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">Page&nbsp;294</span>
cattle,” said he. “Will ten dollars apiece
do you?”</p>

<p>“You had better give us twenty while you
are about it,” said Kelly, as Claude drew his
money out of his vest pocket. “If we get the
twenty thousand dollars——”</p>

<p>“You must get it,” said Claude earnestly.
“In fact, don’t undertake to steal that money
unless you <em>can</em> get it. And then you want to
watch out for the police. When will you
attempt it?”</p>

<p>“To-night, if we get the chance,” said Hayward.
“But we may have to go up to Fort
Scully with them. You go up with Kelly
and he will show you where his room is, and
you can go there and wait until we come
back.”</p>

<p>All the way to the corner, where Hayward
took leave of them, they talked about the
robbery, and Claude again impressed upon
Hayward the dire calamity that would happen
to him if they allowed Thompson to put his
hands behind him. Hayward grinned and
kept on to his own room, while Kelly and
Claude kept on to Kelly’s room, and by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">Page&nbsp;295</span>
time they reached it Kelly had thought up
another method of raising money out of Carl.</p>

<p>“I have several checks in my pocket on
different banks, and I will make one of them
out for a hundred dollars or so,” said he,
“and perhaps I can borrow——”</p>

<p>“You had better let that out,” said Claude
hastily. “Whenever you begin to talk money
to him, he’ll shut up and go away from you.”</p>

<p>“Of course I want to try it merely to see if
he has the funds,” said Kelly. “I don’t care
anything about a hundred dollars while he
has so much more.”</p>

<p>“And there is another thing that you must
look out for,” said Claude. “I had almost forgotten
to mention it. Mr. Morphy told him
this morning not to make friends with anybody.
If you behave at all friendly with him,
and act as though you had seen him before,
the fat will all be in the fire.”</p>

<p>“That old Morphy posted him on a good
many scrapes, didn’t he?” said Kelly, with a
wink that spoke volumes. “I can tell how to
manage him when I see him.”</p>

<p>Kelly’s room was about what Claude had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">Page&nbsp;296</span>
made up his mind to see after his meeting
with him. It was in a tumble-down tenement-house
at the head of two flights of stairs, and
when Kelly produced the key from his pocket
and opened the door, Claude found himself
in a small seven-by-nine apartment which was
almost destitute of furniture. Some dishes
from which Kelly had eaten his supper were
on the table, still unwashed; and the bed,
from which he had arisen that morning, did
not look as though it had been made up for a
week. There was only one chair in the room,
and Kelly gave it a shove with his foot, at the
same time turning toward his trunk to get out
some clothing.</p>

<p>“Sit down there,” said he. “I can remember
when I did not have such a room as this; but
that was before I got to travelling on my own
hook. I suppose you had a better room than
this out West?”</p>

<p>“Well, I had more furniture in it, but it
was not such a room as I would have put a
stranger in,” said Claude, who did not want
to let Kelly see how little he thought of his
quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">Page&nbsp;297</span></p>

<p>He then changed the subject by referring
to Carl and Thompson. It was a matter of
some moment to him, for what should he do
in case these men made the attempt and failed?
He did not like to think of it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">Page&nbsp;298</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV. <br />A Hard Fight.</h2>

<p>In a short time Kelly had produced from
his trunk some clothing which he put
on, and when he announced that he was all
ready Claude turned and looked at him. He
would not have known that it was the same
person who had conducted him to his room.
Aside from the marks of dissipation which
were plainly visible on his face, he looked to
be just what he represented—a traveller out
on business.</p>

<p>“Now all I want is to get shaved, and you
can stay outside the shop and stop Hayward
when he comes along,” said Kelly.</p>

<p>“If his clothing has changed him as much
as it has you I don’t believe I will know him,”
said Claude.</p>

<p>“He will know you, and that’s all you want.
How will this valise do? There is nothing in
it, but nobody is going to see the inside of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">Page&nbsp;299</span></p>

<p>The valise being pronounced satisfactory,
the two went outside into the hall, and Kelly
locked the door and gave the key to Claude.</p>

<p>“You may have to stay here for a week;
for, as Hayward said, we may have to go up
to Fort Scully before we can get a chance to
try him on for his money,” said he. “We
are going to get it before we come back.”</p>

<p>“Remember, a third of it is mine,” said
Claude.</p>

<p>“Of course. We would not have known
anything about it if it had not been for you.”</p>

<p>It was but a few steps to the barber shop,
and Kelly went into it, while Claude stayed
outside, walking up and down in front of it
for fear the police might come along and
order him to “move on.” Before he had
taken many turns he saw somebody coming
up the street with a valise in his hand, who
smiled at Claude the moment he caught sight
of him. It was Hayward, sure enough, but
he never would have recognized him.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder to me how clothes will
change a man,” said Claude. “Kelly’s getting
shaved; he will be out directly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">Page&nbsp;300</span></p>

<p>Hayward and Claude had enough to talk
over during the time that Kelly was in the
barber shop, and when he came out they
turned toward the levee, where the Talisman
was lying. They accidentally caught sight of
Carl and his companion before they got to it,
and Claude lost no time in dodging behind
the wharf-boat out of their view.</p>

<p>“Did you see those two fellows sitting in
chairs on the boiler deck?” said he. “Well,
those are the fellows that have the money.
Take a look at that man with whiskers, and
you will see that his shirt sticks way out
here,” he continued, holding his hand as
much as a foot or more away from his breast.
“I have done all I can for you. It now rests
with you.”</p>

<p>The two men started across the wharf-boat,
ascended the gang-plank, and disappeared behind
the freight in the direction of the stairs.
Looking carefully out from his place of concealment,
Claude saw them go up to the boiler
deck, and, somewhat to his disgust, saw Kelly
stop and address some words to Carl.</p>

<p>“If that is the way they are going to work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">Page&nbsp;301</span>
it I may as well give up,” said Claude, as he
turned and walked away. “He is not going
to make friends with those boys, and he might
as well give it up. But, after all, they are
pretty sharp.”</p>

<p>It was Kelly who spoke to Carl, and when
he was waiting for him to answer the question
he cast a hurried glance at his companion,
and saw that he had the money. If he had
had a coat on, he could not have buttoned the
garment over it. He gave him a look as he
passed, and saw the butts of two ugly revolvers
protruding from Thompson’s hip pockets.</p>

<p>“Well, we have placed the money,” said he
in a low tone to his companion, who walked
by his side. “The question now is, How are
we going to get rid of Carl and double-team
on Thompson to keep him from shooting?
What’s the fare to Fort Scully, please? You
have two passengers with whom I am acquainted,
and we’ll take a room right next to
theirs. Room No. 11, have they? Well,
then, I will take No. 12.”</p>

<p>Their fare was soon paid, their names registered
in the books, and Hayward, at his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">Page&nbsp;302</span>
companion’s suggestion, took their valises into
their own room, to which the clerk showed
him. On the way he noticed that Carl, or
whoever had been in that room before him,
had come out and left the key in the lock instead
of handing it over to the clerk. That
much was in his favor. Hayward made a
great show of putting his valises away, and
then came out into the cabin again and saw
that it was empty, the clerk having gone into
his office and closed the door. With a quick
step Hayward moved to the door of No. 11,
noiselessly opened the door, and went in.
The valises were just where Carl had left
them, stowed away under the bunks. He
pulled them out and saw that they were not
locked, the springs at the side serving to keep
them closed. It was the work of but a very
few minutes to “sound” them, but he saw
that the money was not there. He tumbled
some of the contents of the valises out on the
floor in order to make a thorough examination,
and before he had time to put them back
he heard the cabin door open and Carl and
Thompson come in. He was just in time, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">Page&nbsp;303</span>
with one bound he reached the outside door
of the state-room which opened onto the
guards, and ran along until he came to the
passage that ran through the cabin. A moment
afterward the door he had just left was
thrown open and Carl’s face was stuck out.</p>

<p>“It is not there,” said he to Kelly, whom
he found sitting on the boiler deck a short
time after these incidents happened.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t find it,” said Kelly.
“I told you where the money was when I
went in. Thompson has it, as sure as the
world.”</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Carl and the
cowboy came out again, and when they did,
Kelly gave his companion a sly punch in the
ribs with his elbow. Carl had taken warning
by his experience, or else Thompson had become
nervous and refused longer to act as custodian
of the money, for it had changed
places; in other words, Carl had it. Thompson’s
revolvers had disappeared and his shirt
set naturally, but Carl was the one who was
amply developed this time. They stayed
there until Kelly began to try to talk with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">Page&nbsp;304</span>
them, and then they picked up their chairs
and took a place on the rail.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything work better
than this?” said Kelly, when the cowboys
had taken up a position some little distance
away. “Carl has got the money, and it will
be easy enough to get away with him.”</p>

<p>“If they will only take to sitting on the
rail after dark, we’re all right,” said Hayward.
“That must be our only hope now.”</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before the supper-bell
rang, and longer still after that until
dark came; but finally the dusk of evening
began to settle around them, and to their surprise
no one came aboard the vessel. The
four were there alone. The deck hands were
all below, the captain and the clerk were nowhere
to be seen, and the cabin boys had gone
ashore.</p>

<p>“I guess now is our time,” said Kelly.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Hayward.</p>

<p>The men arose to their feet and walked toward
the cabin to make sure it was deserted,
and then stole cautiously around it until they
came to the place where the cowboys were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">Page&nbsp;305</span>
sitting. Thompson was sitting a little nearer
the bow than Carl, and him Hayward picked
up as if he had been a bag of corn and threw
him over the rail toward the water, while
Kelly at the same time closed with Carl and
bore him to the deck before he could arise
from his chair.</p>

<p>We say that Thompson fell toward the
water, but he did not go into it. He comprehended
the nature of the assault in a moment,
and the first thing he did was to clutch
at the railing with all his force. One hand
caught it, while the other was slipped inside
his coat.</p>

<p>“You villain!” said he.</p>

<p>Hayward knew that in a second more
Thompson would begin to shoot, and he was
equally determined to prevent it, if he could.
He struck the cowboy a blow full in the face,
and then turned his attention to unclasping his
fingers. Thompson could not stand all that,
and he released his hold and went down.
Hayward had got rid of his share, and when
he turned to see how Kelly was getting along,
he saw Carl motionless on his back, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">Page&nbsp;306</span>
shirt torn completely off him. A sand-bag
attached to Kelly’s right wrist explained it all.</p>

<p>“I’ve got one,” said he in a hoarse whisper,
passing a bundle wrapped in a newspaper up to
Hayward, “and here’s the other. Now skip!”</p>

<p>But there was something that both of the
men wanted to do before they went away, and
that was to get rid of Carl. He knew too much,
and might make them some trouble with the
police. Without saying a word they picked
him up, one at the head and the other at his
heels, and tossed him into the river. They
waited a moment to listen to the splash, and
then walked swiftly away. Without appearing
to be in any haste they moved over the
wharf-boat and up the levee, but the farther
they went the more they increased their pace.
They kept a constant watch behind them, but
they saw nothing to indicate that they were
pursued.</p>

<p>“That’s a little the easiest job I ever had,”
said Hayward, feeling the bundle on the inside
of his coat. “That fellow was such an awful
man to shoot! If all the cowboys are like
him the Indians will eat them up, sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">Page&nbsp;307</span></p>

<p>“Where do you suppose they are now,”
said Kelly, who could not resist a thrill of
horror at the thought of throwing the men
into the river.</p>

<p>“They have gone to Davy Jones’s locker,
where they ought to be,” said Hayward. “We
shall never see them again. Now where shall
we go first?”</p>

<p>“Up to my room,” said Kelly. “There’s
where we shall find Claude.”</p>

<p>“I say let us go to my room,” said Hayward.
“We can count the money there, and
he need not know any thing about it.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to cheat Claude?” asked
Kelly in surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that there will be any cheating
about it. He knew where the money was,
and we got it. He thought we were going to
fail; that was what was the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t fail, and through him we got
money that we wouldn’t have been able to
earn in a lifetime,” said Kelly earnestly. “I
won’t cheat Claude. You can go to your room
if you want to, and I will divide my profits
with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">Page&nbsp;308</span></p>

<p>Hayward did not say anything after this,
but Kelly noticed that when he turned toward
his room his companion went also. When
they got to the door they tried to open it, but
the apartment was fastened.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked a voice from the
inside.</p>

<p>It was Claude who gave the challenge. He
was sitting, with his feet on the window-sill,
watching the lamp, which gave out a dim light
through its smoky chimney, threatening every
moment to go out and leave him in darkness.
But his thoughts were far away from there.
He was dreaming about Carl and his money,
and wondering what was going to become of
him if Kelly and his friend were baffled in
their attempts to win it. He had mistrusted
Kelly ever since he saw him speak to Carl,
and had pretty nearly given up all hope; but
the sound of the latch when the door was tried
made his heart bound with exultation.</p>

<p>“It is me,” said Kelly. “Open up.”</p>

<p>It was all Claude could do to find the key,
but he finally opened the door. A glance at
their faces was sufficient for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">Page&nbsp;309</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got it!” he almost gasped.</p>

<p>“You are right, I have,” replied Kelly.
“There’s my pile, and Hayward has the rest.”</p>

<p>“It was not done up this way when it left
the bank,” said Claude, a suspicion creeping
over him. “It has been done up since we left
there.”</p>

<p>He believed then, as he believed afterward,
that Kelly had been duped. With hands that
trembled in spite of himself he tore off the
outside covering, and nothing but a bundle of
paper revealed itself. With a yell that could
have been heard over the house he scattered
the paper all over the floor, but no money appeared.
Kelly and Hayward looked on with
astonishment, and then the latter tore his
own bundle to pieces; but it, too, was filled
with paper. Claude backed toward the chair
and sank into it. He seemed to have lost all
power over himself, for his hands hung by his
side as limp as a piece of wet rope.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV. <br />A Blow For Nothing.</h2>

<p>“Thompson, don’t ever let me go out of
this room again and leave the key in
the lock,” said Carl, as he closed the outer
door of his state-room and threw the catch
into place. “That was not a very bright
trick on my part. It is what caused all this
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Show me the man who did this and I will
make a spread eagle of him right here,” said
Thompson, placing his hand behind him.</p>

<p>“Put up your pistol,” exclaimed Carl angrily.
“If you shoot one of those men you
will only alarm the whole boat; and, besides,
you can’t prove anything. But I have
just thought of something. Sit down here
close to me, so that you can hear what it is.”</p>

<p>It did not take Carl very long to tell
Thompson what he had on his mind, and
when he told him how the money would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">Page&nbsp;311</span>
safe hereafter, his companion jumped up and
drew the funds out of his bosom.</p>

<p>“But are you sure the clerk won’t steal it?”
he asked. “Eight thousand dollars is a heap
of money for some people to have.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am sure of it,” said Carl. “It
is his business to take valuables that his customers
may have and lock them up in the
safe. Take your revolvers from your hip
pockets and put them on the inside of your
coat, and I will give mine to the clerk.”</p>

<p>The first thing was to wrap up the money
in a piece of newspaper, and the second was
to do up two more bundles as near like the
first as they could, and these Carl put on the
inside of his shirt. Then he picked up the
money package and laid his hand upon the
door.</p>

<p>“I like the idea of giving up the money because
I never did want to take it in the first
place,” said Thompson. “But I don’t like
you to have it. Those men could take you
down easy enough.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will not attempt it. They
may suspect what we have done with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">Page&nbsp;312</span>
money, and in that case they will go away
and let us alone.”</p>

<p>Carl cautiously opened the door of his state-room,
and through the glass at the front of
the cabin he saw the two men sitting on the
boiler deck, with their backs toward the office.
They walked lightly toward the room where
the clerk was without attracting the attention
of the men, and pounded upon it. In an instant
the door came open to them.</p>

<p>“Not a word out of you,” whispered Carl.
“There may be some men aboard this boat
who might take it into their heads to rob me,
and I have here eight thousand dollars which
I beg you will take and lock up for me.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the clerk. “Are you
sure the money is in that package?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am. I just put it there.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see it before I touch it.
Unwrap it.”</p>

<p>Of course that was nothing more than fair
for the clerk, for he did not want to take the
package and find that there was nothing of
value in it. Carl readily took off the wrappings,
and showed him the pile of greenbacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">Page&nbsp;313</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the clerk. “Do it
up again. There are only two persons aboard
this boat, and one of them says he is acquainted
with you.”</p>

<p>“The man never told you a bigger lie in
his life,” said Carl indignantly. “I never saw
him until to-day.”</p>

<p>“Do you say that he has an eye on this
money? Then we’ll have him put off.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t prove anything against
them.”</p>

<p>“Can’t eh?” Thompson almost shouted.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud,” said Carl hastily.
“We don’t want those men to know where we
are. The fact of the matter is we left our
valises in our state-rooms, and when we went
in there we found our clothes all over the
floor. Thompson wanted to shoot those men,
but I knew he would only make matters
worse.”</p>

<p>“Do you think those men had a hand in
it?” asked the clerk. “I’ll just watch them,”
he added, as he took the package and locked
it up in his safe.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Now I wish you would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">Page&nbsp;314</span>
put my revolvers with it. They are not
loaded. Thompson will feel safer if he has
his on, where he can put his hands on them.”</p>

<p>After a little more talk on the subject the
clerk went out on the guards, and while he
was there the cowboys slipped out behind him
and came into the cabin through the passage-way
which communicated with the cook’s galley.
They went out on the boiler deck and
stayed there until Kelly began to talk about
money, and then they removed their chairs
around by the side of the cabin, onto the
guards. But if Carl had seen Kelly punch
his companion in the ribs with his elbow, he
would have known that that part of his plot
had been successful. The boys stayed around
on the guards until after supper, and even
when the shades of night began to gather
about them; they remained there until it got so
dark that they could scarcely see their hands
before them. This was the time that Kelly
told his companion that it was the season for
them to begin. Their attack upon them was
so sudden that it was all over before they had
time to think about it. Carl saw Thompson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">Page&nbsp;315</span>
thrown overboard, and before he could cry
out or lift a finger he received a stunning
blow on the head, and then all was blank to
him.</p>

<p>But it was not so with Thompson. The
latter was a strong man, and Hayward had
scarcely picked him up before he was fighting.
He clutched his assailant around the head
with one hand, while with the other he
attempted to save himself from going overboard.
But Hayward was on the alert. He
pulled himself away from Thompson’s encircling
grasp and threw him over the railing;
but the cowboy, whose arms and legs appeared
to be everywhere, caught onto the railing with
his left hand while the other slid inside of his
coat. A moment more and Hayward could
not have told anything about that scrape, for
he would have been laid out with a bullet in
his brain; but he struck him a fierce blow in
the face, unclasped his fingers, and Thompson
went down.</p>

<p>But the blow did not deprive him of consciousness.
He found, in going down to the
water, that he had struck upon one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">Page&nbsp;316</span>
fenders which are used to keep the steamer
off from a wharf-boat when making a landing.
His arms and legs instinctively closed around
it, and, in place of going into the water,
Thompson slid down until his feet rested on
the lower guard. He had barely time to
swing himself on board the boat when he
heard a splash behind him. He turned and
looked at it, and there was Carl, limp and lifeless,
going down with the current. Something
that sounded very much like an oath came
from Thompson’s lips as he let go his hold
upon the fender and struck out to Carl’s assistance.</p>

<p>If there was anything Thompson could do
better than herding cattle it was to swim.
With a few swift strokes he was near enough
to seize Carl, and the first thought that came
into his mind was that the villains, not satisfied
with getting his money, had made an end of
him then and there. He took Carl around
the waist, lifted his head above water, and
swam toward the boat. Swimming now was
a necessity for him, for just below him was a
sidewheel steamer coming in, and if he got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">Page&nbsp;317</span>
down under her guards it was a question
whether or not he would ever come up again.
He made headway through the water as he
had never made it before, and presently caught
hold of the fender that came down opposite
the engine room.</p>

<p>“Hi there, some of you fellows!” shouted
Thompson. “Lend us a hand here.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the engineer was not busy.
He stood watching the deck hands as they
were carrying the freight aboard, and he heard
the hail coming from the water. He ran to
the side, and with a “Heaven bless my soul!
How did you get in?” he seized Carl and
lifted him upon the guards. “Is he dead?”
he asked, with some anxiety in his tones.</p>

<p>“No; but he may as well be,” said Thompson.
“Now, then, help me out. I know the
fellows that did all this, and if I can find
them——”</p>

<p>Thompson could not wait to say any more.
He left Carl where he had fallen and ran up
the stairs to the boiler deck; but he might as
well have saved himself the trouble, for Kelly
and his friend were across the wharf-boat and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">Page&nbsp;318</span>
well on their way up the levee. There were
the chairs, in which they had been sitting,
both overturned, but the men who did the
business were nowhere in sight. Before he
returned to Carl he looked all over the boat,
but still he could not see anything of Kelly
and Hayward.</p>

<p>“Here’s the bump that did all the mischief,”
said the engineer, pointing to a wound
on the back of Carl’s head. “He must have
been hit with something. What was the fuss
all about, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Carl knows, and when he gets ready perhaps
he will tell you about it,” said Thompson.
“Is he never going to speak to me again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s coming around all right
now. You had better take him upstairs and
put him in his bunk.”</p>

<p>“I had not been off the boat twenty minutes
before this thing happened,” said the clerk,
who came up at the time Carl was beginning
to show signs of coming to. “I have had an
eye on them ever since Mr. Preston told me
about it.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” repeated the engineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">Page&nbsp;319</span></p>

<p>There were a good many deck hands standing
around by this time, and the clerk did not
think it best to speak about the money. He
replied that they wanted to whip Carl for
something he had done; and taking him under
one arm, while Thompson took hold of the
other, they took him up to his bunk and put
him into it.</p>

<p>“It beats the world what that fellow hit me
with,” said Carl, placing his hand to his head.
“He struck me with something besides his
fist.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was a sand-bag,” said the
clerk. “A scoundrel can carry one of them
up his sleeve until he gets ready to use it.”</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t get the money, anyway,”
said Carl, drawing a long breath of relief.
“Where are you going, Thompson?”</p>

<p>“I am going out to have those men arrested.
If I can find a policeman anywhere——”</p>

<p>To the surprise of both Thompson and the
clerk, Carl interfered.</p>

<p>“I beg that you will do nothing of the
kind,” said he. “Thompson, come back here
and sit down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">Page&nbsp;320</span></p>

<p>This was said in the form of an order, and
Thompson had nothing to do but obey. Carl
settled back on his pillow and closed his eyes,
and the clerk, readily divining that he was
not wanted there, got up to go.</p>

<p>“If you can think of anything you want,
don’t fail to send Thompson after it and you
shall have it,” said he.</p>

<p>Carl said he would bear that in mind, and
when he was alone with the cowboy he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that if you arrested those
men you would get Claude into a mess?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Did Claude have a hand in
sending those men here?”</p>

<p>“Of course he did. As soon as he got
ashore he went and got those fellows to come
here and steal the money; and if they should
be caught, don’t you see how easy it would be
for them to tell on him?”</p>

<p>“And you want to let him go free because
he is your cousin?”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly. I am doing just as I
believe my father would do if he were here.
Besides, you would be held as a witness. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">Page&nbsp;321</span>
don’t know how long it will be before court sits,
probably a month or six weeks, and you would
have to lay in jail all that time.”</p>

<p>Thompson had no more to say after that.
He did not know how a jail looked on the inside—he
didn’t want to, for if it looked as
badly as it did on the outside it was gloomy
enough—and the idea of staying there for six
weeks filled the foreman with apprehension.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone the boy, let him go!” said he.</p>

<p>“That is what I say. Now, I want you to
stay here.”</p>

<p>Carl hoped they would be allowed to finish
their journey in peace, and that no further
attempts would be made to steal that miserable
money. By the time the boat started he
had recovered from his blow so that he could
be on deck, and by the time they arrived at
Fort Scully he was overjoyed to find his boat
there. The clerk gave Carl his money with
the remark that it was a pity he did not see
his way clearly toward having those men arrested,
for now they would be encouraged to go
on another expedition of the same kind, and
saw him go ashore. In process of time their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">Page&nbsp;322</span>
little boat carried them in safety to Fort Yates,
and, as it was early in the morning, they
hitched up their team and started for home.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness that trip is made,” said
Carl, who felt like yelling when he found
himself on the prairie again, “and I hope it
will be long before I am called upon to make
another. Thompson, I will not take you with
me, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Shake,” said the foreman extending his
hand. “I would sooner be here with the
cattle. But if it had not been for me you
would have gone under the wheels of that
steamer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that is so,” said Carl.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI. <br />The New Scout.</h2>

<p>The prairie home of Carl, the Trailer,
seemed very inviting to him after the
thrilling scenes through which he had passed
on the Mississippi, and sometimes he was
almost tempted to send word to the commander
of the fort that certain circumstances over
which he had no control would keep him at
home. There everybody was friendly to him,
his word was law, and it was reasonable to
suppose that he could get along with them
better than he could with strangers. But
whichever way he turned he found something
to remind him of his father, and he hoped
that, surrounded with new associations and
new scenes, he would be led to forget the past
and so begin life anew.</p>

<p>“Now, Thompson,” said Carl, when he
found himself in the office, and the money
which had cost him so much trouble was laid
out on the table, “I begin by carrying out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">Page&nbsp;324</span>
the conditions of the will this very afternoon.
You want two thousand dollars; and I may
add that, in giving it to you, I give it with my
full and free consent. You have earned it by
your strict attention to duty, and if you ever
want any more money come to me and get it.”</p>

<p>This was almost too much for Thompson to
stand. He looked around for a chair, and
when he found it he dropped helplessly into
it. No man could have stood a “cussing”
better then he, but when it came to such talk
as this, it took all the pluck out of him.</p>

<p>“Are you still going to the fort?” he managed
to ask.</p>

<p>“Yes, I must go there. I promised the
colonel, and I always like to keep my word.”</p>

<p>“Will you be gone long?”</p>

<p>“I shall be gone until I learn to be as good
a scout as there is attached to headquarters.
We are going to see war pretty soon——”</p>

<p>“Now, I hope you won’t pay any attention
to what those teamsters at Fort Yates said to
you,” said Thompson in disgust. “The Sioux
have got whipped so bad that they will never
try it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">Page&nbsp;325</span></p>

<p>“But you see, Thompson, there are more
of them here than there are of us. Sitting
Bull isn’t going to be quiet for any length of
time. There’s your money. Count it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it is all right, and I won’t
count it, if you please,” said Thompson slowly.
“When do you start for the fort?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning bright and early. I
need not ask you to keep an eye on things
while I am gone. I will be up here every
few days, just to see how things are getting
along.”</p>

<p>Thompson had already said all he could to
keep Carl at home, and he knew that it was
breath wasted. He went out and sent in the
cook to get his money, and then seated himself
on the doorstep and rested his head on his
hands. One by one the men were settled with
according to the terms of his father’s will, and
after that Carl put on his hat and went out
to his sire’s grave. How long he stayed there
no one knew, but when he came back his eyes
were red and he went into his own room.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, Carl was himself
again. He ate a hearty breakfast, shook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">Page&nbsp;326</span>
the men warmly by the hand, and set off at a
gallop. He was dressed in a suit that was
more becoming to him than the one he wore
to St. Louis. He wore a tight-fitting suit of
moleskin, with a Mexican sombrero and heavy
gauntlet gloves. At his waist he carried his
revolver, and at his back his Winchester rifle,
supported by a broad band which crossed
his breast. In his saddle-bags he carried an
extra suit, another pair of boots, a shirt or two,
and ammunition for his rifle. His horse was a
mustang, small and clean-limbed, and although
he did not move as though he had any “go”
in him, his rider was willing to ride him a
twenty-mile race with any horse on the plains.
Taken altogether he was a very fancy-looking
scout, as some of the soldiers said when he
drew up to report to the colonel; but they
found out that there was something more than
fancy about him when he came to fulfill his
duty.</p>

<p>“Well, Carl, I am glad to see you,” said
the colonel, as the orderly took in his name.
He had left his horse outside in the hands of
a teamster, and his rifle and saddle bags were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">Page&nbsp;327</span>
on the porch. “I have business for you
right away,” added the colonel; “but first I
want to know how much you are going to
charge me.”</p>

<p>“I want nothing, sir, except my board,”
said Carl.</p>

<p>“Nothing?” exclaimed the commander.
“And will you be ready to go night and day
whenever I shall call upon you?”</p>

<p>Carl replied that he would.</p>

<p>“That is cheap enough. You had better
take another horse, for I am going to send you
to Fort Yates.”</p>

<p>“I guess my horse will do for that journey,”
said Carl with a smile. “I am more used to
him than I am to any other animal.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that Carl, the Trailer,
got a position without going out of his own
country. For two years he stayed there at
the fort, making occasional trips to his ranch
to see how things were going on there, and
every time the colonel called for him he was
there. He boarded with the teamsters while
he was at the fort, but his favorite duty, and
the one he most delighted in, was guiding the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">Page&nbsp;328</span>
hunting expeditions to the mountains to get
fresh meat for the garrison. Every time Carl
went off in this way he was certain to come
back with his wagons well filled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">Page&nbsp;329</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII. <br />Off to the Front.</h2>

<p>But Carl’s way was not clear yet. He had
one hundred and twenty-five miles to
go before he would be among friends, and not
a mouthful to eat while he was travelling that
distance. It was true that he had revolvers
in his pockets, and that jack rabbits were
plenty. He had matches, too, in his possession,
so that he could cook the meat after
he shot it, but the report of his revolver
might start the Indians looking for him.
The boy thought of this as he sped on his
way, and by the time daylight arrived he
stood upon the banks of Grand River, which
separated him from the trail that led to Fort
Scott. Before he took to the willows he
looked cautiously around, but there were no
Indians to be seen.</p>

<p>“Those Indians who were going to the Bad
Lands to fight the whites must have gone by
the upper trail,” said Carl, as he took off his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">Page&nbsp;330</span>
blanket and drew his revolvers, which he took
in one hand and held above his head. “If
that is the case I am all right. Lie there,”
he added, throwing the blanket into the willows.
“I have carried you twenty-five miles,
and you haven’t done me any good, either.”</p>

<p>Carl took another glance around to make
sure that the way was clear, and entered the
water. He did not know how deep the water
was, but by swimming and wading alternately
he managed to cross the river, and without
any more reconnoitering he struck out straight
for the fort. During all his lonely journey
he did not see an Indian, or a white man,
either, to whom he could give the news of
Sitting Bull’s death—for it was the source of
a great deal of satisfaction to him. The brains
of the Sioux nation were gone, and where
would they look to find another man to take
his place? Every time he thought of it he
felt like yelling; and one time he did raise
his voice, but stopped all of a sudden, and
glanced around to see if there was anybody
within hearing.</p>

<p>The day passed away and night came on,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">Page&nbsp;331</span>
but the fort was every moment drawing
nearer. He was tired and sleepy, but he
could not think of stopping to rest until he
conveyed the news to the commander of Fort
Scott. He was certain that there had not
been anybody along the trail, for he would
have seen them; so he was going to be the
first to carry the information. About twelve
o’clock he became aware that he was at his
journey’s end. He heard a challenge directly
in front of him, and Carl came to a
standstill. It seemed to him that the corporal
was a long time in coming, but he heard the
gate unfastened at last, and the non-commissioned
officer came out.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked, bending over
and looking into Carl’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I have got a right here,” said
the young scout. “Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>“By gracious!” exclaimed the corporal.
“Carl, the Trailer!”</p>

<p>“That is just what they call me when I am
here among friends. I am tired and sleepy,
but I want first to see the colonel. I have a
report to make to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">Page&nbsp;332</span></p>

<p>“Come in. Lieutenant Parker is officer of
the guard, and I know he will be delighted to
see you. He has been on nettles every time
your name is mentioned.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker was standing in front
of his quarters waiting to see what the corporal
was going to find outside the gate, and
when he saw the two coming along the parade
he came quickly toward them.</p>

<p>“I have got him, sir,” said the corporal.</p>

<p>If we were to say that the two boys were
delighted to see each other we should fall far
short of the truth. Carl held out his hand,
but the lieutenant paid no attention to it.
He rushed in, caught Carl around his arms,
and whirled him with his feet clear of the
ground, all unmindful of the presence of the
corporal. Then he put him down and seized
him by the hand.</p>

<p>“I tell you I can rest in peace now,” said
Parker. “Carl, how do you do? How did
you escape?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a long story to tell you,” said
Carl, “but first I must see the colonel. I
ought to report to him the first thing I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">Page&nbsp;333</span></p>

<p>“Come in here with me just a minute and
then you can call on the colonel,” said the
lieutenant, leading the way into his quarters.
“I want to look at you.”</p>

<p>“Say,” said Carl in a lower tone, as the
lieutenant closed the door behind him, “Sitting
Bull is dead.”</p>

<p>Parker had picked up a chair to place it for
Carl to sit down, but he stopped when these
words fell upon his ear and put the chair
down again.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Carl. “He resisted arrest
and he was shot dead.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—who told you?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“A courier came into the camp and reported
it, and I jumped at the chance for
escape.”</p>

<p>“Who killed him?”</p>

<p>“The Indian police. Now, do you think I
ought to report that to the colonel or wait until
morning?”</p>

<p>“Go at once and report it. So Sitting
Bull is dead. Come back here after you see
the colonel and tell me your story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">Page&nbsp;334</span></p>

<p>“I will, after I get something to eat and
put some extra clothes on. I haven’t had
these duds off for a week.”</p>

<p>“I will get you something to eat,” said the
lieutenant. “I am anxious to hear what Sitting
Bull did.”</p>

<p>The two boys went out, and Carl bent his
steps toward the colonel’s room. The orderly,
who sat at a table in the hall reading, was
overjoyed to see Carl once more, and after
listening to his report that he had something
to say to the commander that ought not to be
kept until to-morrow, went into where the
colonel was lying.</p>

<p>“He will see you,” said he. “He won’t
get up.”</p>

<p>The colonel was sitting up in bed, striving
with both hands to make his few gray hairs
cover his bald head, but he extended a palm
to Carl and greeted him warmly.</p>

<p>“So General Miles took me at my word,
did he?” he asked.</p>

<p>“General Miles?” repeated Carl. “I don’t
know what you mean, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, I sent him notice that you had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">Page&nbsp;335</span>
been captured by the Sioux band when they
were not on the warpath, and requested him
to demand your surrender.”</p>

<p>“This is the first I heard of it, sir,” said
Carl, who wondered that the colonel thought
so much of him as all that. “If he sent any
word to the Sioux I don’t know it.”</p>

<p>The commander looked surprised but said
nothing, and Carl went on with his report.
He looked more surprised as he listened, asked
a few questions to get at all Carl knew about
the matter, and finally said:</p>

<p>“It serves him right. This Sioux war won’t
amount to much.”</p>

<p>After a few moments’ conversation, during
which Carl told him of the way he had escaped,
he went out and found Lieutenant Parker
waiting for him, who told him he would find
everything he wanted to eat in the officers’
quarters, and that as soon as he had changed
his clothes, and had taken the sharp edge off
his appetite, he was expected to tell his story.
Carl hurried away, and in half an hour more
he was in Lieutenant Parker’s quarters, who
was out somewhere, but when he came in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">Page&nbsp;336</span>
few moments later he found Carl filling up for
a smoke.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Parker, my pipe was the only
friend I had while I was posting along that
prairie in the direction of the fort,” said he, as
he pulled a match from his pocket and struck
a light. “It could not say anything to me,
but I drew almost as much encouragement
from it as I would from my horse, if I had
had one.”</p>

<p>The young scout then seated himself and
went on with his story, omitting no detail that
he thought would be at all interesting to Lieutenant
Parker. When he told of the Ghost
Dance, he held his excited auditor spellbound.</p>

<p>“It was the queerest thing in the shape of
a dance that I ever heard of,” said Carl.
“There was literally nothing that was interesting
about it. They go round and round
until they get tired, and then they drop.”</p>

<p>“Did you see anybody in a trance?” asked
Parker.</p>

<p>“No, I got tired of watching the thing and
went to sleep. If any one was tormented in
that way it was after dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">Page&nbsp;337</span></p>

<p>Carl stayed up with the lieutenant all that
night, and when morning came and they were
relieved he went off to his quarters to find a
little rest in sleep. But all the teamsters were
up, and he had to go through with the same
thing again. Of course he did not say anything
about Sitting Bull’s death. He had
made a report of that to the colonel, and he
wisely decided that the information could come
through him. Everywhere he was regarded
as a hero, but no one could understand why
Harding had suddenly become so lenient to
him.</p>

<p>“I guess Harding has not got much stomach
for a fight,” said one of the teamsters; “I
don’t believe he thinks there is going to be
one;” and this was the general verdict of all
of them. But finally it came out, nobody
knew how, that Sitting Bull was dead. Of
course everybody was excited when they heard
of it, but there were not a few who believed,
with the colonel, “that this Sioux war won’t
amount to much.” What was their surprise,
however, when a white courier rode into the
fort about ten o’clock that morning, on a horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">Page&nbsp;338</span>
almost ready to drop with fatigue, and brought
a letter from General Miles. Of course there
were plenty of soldiers around who saw him
go in, and they were wrought up to the highest
pitch of excitement while waiting for some one
to come out.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Carl, there is something up,”
whispered Parker to the young scout. “That
man never came here with all that haste for
nothing. We are going to see something.”</p>

<p>“I hope you can go,” said Carl. “I won’t
see any fun at all if you are left behind.”</p>

<p>“You will go, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will. If the Indians are going
to have a dressing down, I am going to have
a hand in it.”</p>

<p>The two curbed their impatience as well as
they could and watched the colonel’s door.
In a few moments the orderly came out on a
run and bent his steps toward the adjutant’s
quarters; and in a second more out came that
officer, bareheaded and with no coat on, and
straightway went into the colonel’s room. This
made the boys more inclined to believe that
“there was something up,” and this became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">Page&nbsp;339</span>
realized when the adjutant came out and
called for the trumpeter.</p>

<p>“Now we are going to hear it,” said Parker.
“I hope they will call for Company D the
first thing.”</p>

<p>The men at a distance took up the call for
“the trumpeter,” sounding it out loud and
clear, and presently the man appeared with
his instrument in his hand. He exchanged a
few words with the adjutant, then threw back
his head and put his trumpet to his lips. He
did not blow the call for any particular company,
but he blew the general muster of the
cavalry; whereupon Parker almost jumped
from the ground.</p>

<p>“Whoopee! I am going,” said he, seizing
Carl’s arm with a grip that astonished him.
“You must go, too. Where’s your horse?”</p>

<p>This was something that Carl had not yet
had time to attend to—getting a horse to replace
the one that he had left in the hands of
the Sioux. The very first man he came to
was a teamster who had a couple of horses,
and he raised no objections whatever to loaning
Carl the best one in the lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">Page&nbsp;340</span></p>

<p>“It won’t take you long to decide which
one is the best,” said he, as he led the way out
of the gate, “’cause one is about as good as the
other. They don’t look as though they had
any get up about them, but you get on ’em
and try ’em.”</p>

<p>“Will he run fast if the Indians get after
him?” asked Carl, as he slipped a bridle on
the horse while the teamster put a saddle on
his back.</p>

<p>“Are you going out after the Indians?”
inquired the man in surprise. “By George!
you want to look out.”</p>

<p>“That is the reason I asked the question.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen this horse in a race, but
I bet you he will get there. Look out that
they don’t play the same trick on you that
they played upon Custer.”</p>

<p>“I will look out for that. You come in
on the parade-ground and hold him while I
get my things.”</p>

<p>When Carl hurried through the gate he saw
a long line of cavalry drawn up on the parade-ground,
with their officers at the head, and
the adjutant was just going into the colonel’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">Page&nbsp;341</span>
door to tell him that the troops were all present
or accounted for. They were all sitting stiffly
in their saddles, waiting for the word to move.
They were waiting to see, too, who was going
to command them; but in a few seconds after
the adjutant disappeared the colonel came to
the door, and then this question was answered.
He had his greatcoat on, a pair of heavy
gauntlet gloves on his hands, and the point
of a sabre dragged on the ground behind him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Carl, making haste
into his room. “Now we will see how much
the colonel knows about fighting Indians.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII. <br />Getting Ready For the Fight.</h2>

<p>All the cavalry stationed at Fort Scott was
in line. The “Sorrels,” the “Blacks,”
the “Grays” and the “Bays”—so called
from the color of the horses they rode—were
there, eager for a move; and they all had
their heavy overcoats on, and were equipped
for a long and heavy march. The weather
was as fine as anybody could ask for at that
season of the year; the mornings were crisp
and cold—just the time to put both horses
and men in good trim for a headlong gallop;
but everybody knew that by the time they
got back again they would bring a blizzard
with them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker sat erect on his horse,
with his eyes “straight to the front, striking
the ground at a distance of fifteen yards;”
but he had an eye out for Carl, the Trailer.
Without turning his head he saw him rush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">Page&nbsp;343</span>
into his room, and when he came out again he
did not look much like the boy who had gone
in a few moments before. He was bundled up
all ready for a march. He saw him mount
his horse—a sorry-looking old horse it was,
too—ride around in the rear of the line, and
take up a position a short distance behind
his friend. The colonel exchanged a few
words with the captain he was going to leave
in command of the post, and then turned to
the adjutant, who started off to put the column
in motion. “Fours right!” he shouted;
and in a few minutes the men were through
the gate and threading their way across the
prairie.</p>

<p>“I declare, you got a horse, didn’t you?”
said the lieutenant, who, now that the line
was fairly in motion, could talk all he wanted
to. “Who’s is it? I hope the Indians will
not get after us. If they do, you are gone
up.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going—do you know?”
asked Carl.</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain, but from something
I heard the colonel tell the adjutant I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">Page&nbsp;344</span>
think we are going down to the Bad Lands,”
answered Lieutenant Parker. “We are in
pursuit of Big Foot, who became alarmed at
the death of Sitting Bull and is running off to
save himself.”</p>

<p>“If the Indians would just come in and behave
themselves they would save lots of lives
by it.”</p>

<p>The Bad Lands were quite a distance from
Fort Scott—one hundred and ninety-two
miles as the crow flies. In order to get upon
the trail of Big Foot they were obliged to go
across the Cheyenne reservation, through a
section of South Dacota, which at that time
was not given up to any Indians, and go the
whole length of Pine Ridge reservation, before
they would come up with him. How the
general knew so soon that he was going to
run away, was a mystery. Probably he knew
something about Big Foot that others did not
know, and had had his eye upon him for a
long time. He feared Big Foot, with his little
band of six hundred Sioux, more than he
did the other Indians, and he thought that if
he could get him to surrender the Sioux war
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">Page&nbsp;345</span>
would be brought to an end at once. But Big
Foot had ninety miles the start of him, and
those who have followed Indians while they
were retreating from a foe know that he would
travel night and day but that he would reach
his destination before his pursuers did.</p>

<p>The Indians, when they go on the warpath,
do not generally take much in the way of
plunder to hinder their movements. Everything
is thrown away except that which they
actually need. Their squaws and children
are mounted on fast horses, and they must
keep up with the men or stand the chance of
being captured. They even throw away their
tepee poles, and that is something they do not
often do. If they camp in a place where poles
cannot be found they have to sleep out in the
open air, and an Indian says that is not good
for him. When they reach the Bad Lands
they are comparatively safe. Nobody knows
where those gullies and ravines lead to except
the Indian; he knows where he can get water
when he wants it, and he knows where the
gullies afford the best purpose of resistance.
It is no wonder that the Indians go there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">Page&nbsp;346</span>
when they get into trouble. Carl knew all
this, and was explaining it to the lieutenant
as they rode along.</p>

<p>“We ought to have some guns along so as
to get them out of those ravines,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“If we could get an enfilading fire on them——”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we shall pick up some
guns as we go along,” said Carl. “But I
know that it is useless to try them with small
arms. Give an Indian five minutes’ start and
you will never see him again. Just wait until
you see the Bad Lands. There is not a
tree or a bush on it, and how the Indians can
live there beats me.”</p>

<p>At this moment the adjutant galloped up
and interrupted their conversation.</p>

<p>“Preston, the colonel wants you out ahead,”
said he.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I can show him the
way or not,” said Carl, a little taken back by
this order. “But I will have to go and try.
Good-by, Parker. I’ll see you when we get
into a fight with the Indians.”</p>

<p>Carl rode up and saluted the colonel, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">Page&nbsp;347</span>
was ordered to put himself on the trail and go
ahead as fast as his pony could stand it. The
trail was plain enough,—it had been made by
the Indians while going to and from the Pine
Ridge Agency,—and Carl at once put his
pony into a trot and followed it up without
any hesitation at all. The column was kept
closed up all the while, and there was no
talking allowed in the ranks. They kept on
until they reached some willows that fringed
the banks of a stream, and there the colonel
announced that they would stop to allow their
horses a few moments of rest and to wait for
the wagons, which were lumbering along some
distance in the rear. At the end of an hour,
having eaten their dinner and smoked their
pipes, the column mounted again and set off in
pursuit of Big Foot.</p>

<p>“Well, Carl, what do you think of it?”
asked the colonel, as he rode up beside the
scout, who was going along in his usual trot.
“Is this what you came to the fort for—to
hunt Indians?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I think you had better hold
up a bit,” answered Carl. “Your horses do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">Page&nbsp;348</span>
not act as though they could stand it, and
they will be pretty well played out to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why, your horse doesn’t seem to mind it
a bit,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“No, sir, because he is a mustang. Leave
him at the stable lines for six months and he
will go just the same as he does now; but your
horses have not been used to this.”</p>

<p>The colonel thought it was about time that
he was turning back to look at his animals,
and he found that Carl was right when he
spoke about the horses being “played out.”
Half the horses were moving along with their
heads down as if almost on the point of going
to sleep, and it was only when their riders
slyly punched them with their spurs that they
began to take an interest in going ahead.
The colonel spoke to his adjutant, and presently
the column came down to a walk.</p>

<p>At night, just as the sun was setting, they
came within sight of Big Foot’s camp. There
was no one there, but everything bore evidence
to a hurried departure by the original
owners. Of course the column prepared for
night by examining into things. The horses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">Page&nbsp;349</span>
were staked out and placed under a guard;
farther out there were other dismounted men
who looked after the safety of the camp, and
others went to work to prepare supper.
Carl took care of his pony and then strolled
about the camp to see what things had been
left behind by the Indians. The camp reminded
him of a town that had been burned
by fire. The lodge poles were up in every
direction, but the tepees themselves had disappeared.
Counting them, and taking into
consideration the fact that ten or twelve Indians
occupied one lodge, he came to the conclusion
that there were fully six hundred men
and women in the whole camp. And half of
them were armed and willing to fight; and,
besides, he did not know how many more they
would pick up on their way to the Bad Lands.</p>

<p>“Look at this,” said Parker, who had got
through with his duties of the camp and came
out to see what he could find. As he spoke
he picked up a frying-pan which he had
found in one of the tepees. “But I don’t see
anything but cooking utensils. Where are
the weapons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">Page&nbsp;350</span></p>

<p>“The weapons are in the hands of the Indians
and are well on their way to the Bad
Lands by this time,” said Carl. “He does
not need cooking utensils, but he does need
weapons, as you may find out one of these
days.”</p>

<p>The officers, one and all, searched the
camp; but all they could find were articles
of clothing, head-dresses, and things that the
Indians could do without. Nothing in the
shape of weapons could be found. At last
there was a call to supper, and after that they
sat about the fires and smoked. A good many
of the soldiers had seen deserted camps before;
and, in view of the hard ride that was
coming on the morrow, they prepared for it
by rolling themselves up in their blankets
and going to sleep.</p>

<p>There was not a sound to disturb them
during the night. At reveille the men all
sprang up and were ready to face the duties
of the day, whether it was to remain in the
saddle or to fight Indians.</p>

<p>“I don’t forget what they did to Custer,”
said a soldier who picketed his horse near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">Page&nbsp;351</span>
Carl’s, “and I want to get a chance at them
for that. I haven’t been in many fights since
that happened, but when I have been in one,
I didn’t take any prisoners. If we get into a
fuss now before we come back, you may bet
your bottom dollar that every one I shoot at
stays there.”</p>

<p>“Do all the men feel that way?” asked
Carl.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, every one of them,” said the
soldier earnestly. “A person who does not
feel that way has got no business in the
army.”</p>

<p>Carl looked at the soldier as he walked off
with his horse. He was tall and broad-shouldered,
and looked as though he might
whip all the Indians who could get around
him. He thought of what he said a few days
afterward, when he saw him in a fight. He
saw plenty of Indians drop before his aim,
but he did not see him bring in any prisoners.</p>

<p>While the men were grooming their horses,
which they did with little tufts of grass that
came handy to them, the orderly sergeants
called the roll without looking into any books;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">Page&nbsp;352</span>
after which they reported to the adjutant, and
the adjutant reported to the colonel. Very
soon “Boots and saddles” was called, and in
a few moments the column was on the march.</p>

<p>Carl took the lead, as he did on a former occasion,
and about three o’clock in the afternoon
they came within sight of a camp of soldiers.
Colonel Forsyth was the commanding officer,
and to him the report was made. He ordered
the cavalry to take up their positions on the
opposite ravine, so as to have the Indians surrounded
when they came in to deliver up
their arms.</p>

<p>“I have some trustworthy Indians out
now, looking for some that got into the Bad
Lands,” said Colonel Forsyth, “and I am
looking for them to come in every day.
When they come in we’ll disarm them, and
then we would like to see them raise another
fuss.”</p>

<p>“Say, Parker, look at that,” said Carl, as
the cavalry moved on to its position. “We
have some guns.”</p>

<p>“Where?” said the lieutenant, looking all
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">Page&nbsp;353</span></p>

<p>“Over there on the hill. When the Sioux
come in they will be camped over there on the
plain, and if they attempt any outbreak the
guns will mow them down right and left.”</p>

<p>“They are Hotchkiss guns, too. We are
not going to see any fight with the Indians.
While the colonel was reporting, there was an
officer told me that there is a whole body of
troops in the Bad Lands; so the best thing
they can do is to surrender.”</p>

<p>“This ravine is the only thing that bothers
me,” said the colonel, as he rode to his position
and gave the necessary orders for preparing
camp. “Suppose those Indians come in here
and object to giving up their arms. Don’t
you see that they can take to the ravine and
run out, and we could not stop them? Those
guns there would shoot over the ravine and
hurt some of us.”</p>

<p>And the colonel was right in his suspicions.
Some of the Indians made use of that ravine
to get back to the Bad Lands. The guns were
moved up in time to cover the ravine, but
some of the Sioux managed to get away, after
all.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX. <br />The Battle of Wounded Knee.</h2>

<p>“If there is anything I do despise it is to
wait on an Indian until he gets ready
to do anything,” said Carl, after they had
waited three or four days to receive the Sioux
who had gone into the Bad Lands. “An
Indian has no idea of the value of time, and
he thinks that a month or six weeks from now
will do the same as though he came in to-morrow.
All they want is a dance to make
up their minds whether to come in and surrender
or not.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker was getting sadly impatient
also, and he began to think that the
Indians would not come in at all, that they
would be alarmed at so many troops coming
to surround them, and that they would decide
to stay in the Bad Lands and fight it out; but
one day they were electrified by the arrival
of a courier who rode at once to Colonel Forsyth’s
tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">Page&nbsp;355</span></p>

<p>“Something is going to happen now,” said
Carl. “That man has brought news of some
kind.”</p>

<p>“Go over there, Carl,” said Parker. “Our
colonel is there. You are not an enlisted
man, and you can go and come when you
please.”</p>

<p>Carl mounted his horse, which he always
kept saddled and ready for instant use, and
rode over to Colonel Forsyth’s headquarters.
He loafed around there for a spell, waiting to
hear what was going on, and a few moments
later his colonel came out.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what’s up, sir?” said
Carl.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, only the Indians are coming
in at last,” answered the officer.</p>

<p>“How many of them are there?”</p>

<p>“About four hundred; but we have eight
hundred men here, so I guess they will not
attempt any tricks.”</p>

<p>Carl rode back to his camp in company
with the colonel, who summoned his officers
and held a short consultation with them.
Parker and the rest of the young officers, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">Page&nbsp;356</span>
had never seen a hostile camp before, listened
to what Carl had to tell them, and then turned
their attention to the pass through which the
courier had come out. But it was a long time
before the Indians arrived. Just as the sun
was setting they came into view, and there
were so many of them that Parker grew
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Have those Indians all got guns?” he
asked. “I don’t see anything to indicate the
fact.”</p>

<p>“They have guns, for you never saw an
Indian go on the warpath without one; but
they have them hidden where we can’t find
them,” said Carl. “When the order is given
to disarm them, you will see what sort of
weapons we are going to get—old, worthless
things that you wouldn’t pick up in the street.”</p>

<p>“Then the soldiers will search their tepees
for them,” said a young officer decidedly.</p>

<p>“Of course; and that is what is going to
bring on the fight.”</p>

<p>“Are we really going to have a brush with
them?”</p>

<p>“I think so, and you may make up your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">Page&nbsp;357</span>
mind to hear how a bullet whistles as it goes
by your head.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t they begin it, if that is
what they are up to?”</p>

<p>“It is too late to do anything to-day, but it
will keep. You wait until to-morrow and you
will wish that you were back at the fort.”</p>

<p>“Not much, I won’t,” said Parker indignantly.
“If my men have come out here to
fight Indians, I am going in, too.”</p>

<p>“I see a big tepee off there, sir,” said one
of the officers to his captain, who at that moment
came up, “and they are carrying somebody
into it. Who is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“That is Big Foot, who is ill with pneumonia,”
answered the captain; “and the doctor
who has just gone in to attend to him is Colonel
Forsyth’s surgeon.”</p>

<p>“And there are some soldiers taking in a
stove,” added the officer. “They are going
to warm him up. I supposed that when an
Indian became sick he would kick out all the
white surgeons and depend entirely on his
medicine man.”</p>

<p>“So he does, generally,” said the captain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">Page&nbsp;358</span>
“but old Big Foot is so bad now that he can’t
attend to anything. I hope you boys will get
a good sleep to-night, for we are going to have
fun in the morning.”</p>

<p>But the boys did not get a good sleep, for
they were busy thinking of what was going
to happen when daylight came—that is, all
except Carl, who would have found rest if he
had known that the Indians were powerful
enough to massacre their whole command.
When morning came he was as bright as a
lark, while Parker and the other young officers
were pale and nervous, and kept looking forward
to that order to disarm the Indians
which would transform their peaceable camp
into a scene that they did not like to think of.</p>

<p>It was the morning of December 29th, and
as soon as breakfast was eaten the cavalry
mounted their horses and stretched themselves
out in a single line far beyond the ground occupied
by the Indian encampment, and the
infantry moved up within ten yards of their
position. The Indians evidently did not like
this, for they congregated in little groups, and
talked violently, and made motions which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">Page&nbsp;359</span>
Lieutenant Parker thought meant war and
nothing else. Finally an interpreter went
among them, and after a long wait the warriors
all moved out in a body and seated
themselves on the ground. Then Colonel
Forsyth took a hand in the matter, and, with
the interpreter at his side, told the Indians
that he had come out there for the purpose of
disarming them, and ordered them back to
their tepees to bring out their weapons. A
part of the Indians went, and after a long
wait they brought out two guns, which they
handed to the soldiers.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” said the colonel in a loud
voice. “I want each one of you to bring out
the weapons that you use in fighting us. If
you don’t do it, my men will go in there and
search your houses.”</p>

<p>“Now it is coming,” said Carl in a low
tone to his friend, and he got down and buckled
up his saddle. “When the soldiers go in
there, you can make up your mind to advance.”</p>

<p>The Indians did not move, and all the while
Yellow Bird, a medicine man, was walking
about among them, blowing on a whistle made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">Page&nbsp;360</span>
of an eagle bone and talking to them in the
Sioux language. He was telling them that
they need not be afraid, for their ghost shirts
would render the soldiers weak and powerless,
and that their bullets would fall harmlessly to
the ground.</p>

<p>“If I was Colonel Forsyth I would arrest
that Indian the first thing,” said Carl, who
was rendered awfully impatient by the Sioux
actions. “Why don’t he make that man talk
English.”</p>

<p>“What is he doing?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“I don’t catch the words very distinctly,
but he is urging them on to fight,” said Carl.
“I wonder if those Indians have ghost shirts
on? If they have, that is what he is depending
on.”</p>

<p>Still the Indians did not move to go into
their tepees and bring out more weapons, and
Colonel Forsyth, becoming impatient, ordered
the soldiers up closer and sent a party to
search the tepees. After a thorough hunt
these last returned with about forty rifles,
most of which were old and of little value.
The search had consumed considerable time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">Page&nbsp;361</span>
and created a good deal of excitement among
the women and children, as the soldiers found
it necessary to overturn the beds and other
furniture of the houses, and sometimes to drive
the inmates out of doors. One of the searchers,
in coming out, attempted to raise the blanket
of one of the warriors, and that seemed to be
all Yellow Bird was waiting for. Suddenly
he stooped down and seized a handful of dust
which he threw into the air, and in an instant
afterward a young Cheyenne brave threw off
his blanket and fired at the soldiers.</p>

<p>“It is come! it is come!” exclaimed Carl,
who was so excited that he could hardly sit
still on his horse. “That means war. Now
get ready.”</p>

<p>The smoke of the warrior’s gun had scarcely
died away when an answering volley came
from the soldiers, and they were so close to the
Sioux that the guns almost touched each other.
After that all was confusion to Lieutenant
Parker, although he tried his best to mind what
he was doing. He heard the adjutant shout
“Forward!” and drove his horse down the
ravine, and Carl was right close behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">Page&nbsp;362</span></p>

<p>“Shoot to kill!” said the captain. “Don’t
throw away a single bullet!”</p>

<p>At first it was not possible for any of the
cavalry to shoot, so busy were they in working
their way down one side of the gully and
up the other; but by the time they were on
solid ground once more, the yell that went
up from five hundred lungs must have added
to the panic of the frightened Indians; for
the Indians were frightened, there could be no
doubt about that. They fought bravely for a
few minutes, but their ghost shirts did not
avail them. They saw their comrades fall on
every side, they heard the shouts of the
soldiers as they pressed them from every side,
and finally they turned and sought safety in
flight. Lieutenant Parker did not draw his
sword from the time he started until the bugle
sounded the recall. He used his revolver,
and those who knew him said he was a very
passable shot. The Hotchkiss guns got the
range of the ravine when they saw the Indians
escaping that way. They fired two-pound
explosive shells at the rate of fifty a
minute, cutting down everything that was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">Page&nbsp;363</span>
alive. In a few minutes there were two hundred
men, women and children lying dead
and wounded on the ground, the tepees had
been torn down by shells, some of them were
burning above the helpless wounded, and the
surviving handful of Sioux were flying in a
wild panic to the shelter of the ravine. Sixty
soldiers were also lying on the ground, which
shows how hard the Indians fought at the beginning
of the battle.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker did not try to hold in
his horse when he got fairly out of the ravine.
The animal had never been in action before,
but he seemed to delight in the whistling of
balls and the roaring of cannon. Whenever
Parker saw an Indian he pulled on him, and
whenever he missed, it is sure that the boy
who followed close at his side did <em>not</em> miss
with his Winchester. They followed the
Sioux for a mile or more, and then the lieutenant
heard the sound of the bugle. It was
the recall, and he forthwith returned his
empty revolver to its holster and shouted to
the men who were nearest to him.</p>

<p>“Cease firing!” he yelled. “Don’t you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">Page&nbsp;364</span>
hear the bugle sounding a recall? How did
you work it, Murphy?” he added, turning to
a soldier who had oftentimes told him that he
would not take any prisoners. “Did you see
any drop?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I did, sir,” said he. “I
thought ‘Remember Custer’ all the time I
was doing it. Halloo, there’s one. I guess I
will fix him so that he won’t kill any more
soldiers.”</p>

<p>Murphy stopped in front of a wounded
Sioux, who raised on his elbow and looked at
him with a countenance full of vindictive
fury. He was shot through both legs, and of
course he fell to the ground. The soldier felt
all over his person but could not find a cartridge
left.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said he, throwing himself off
his horse. “You’ve got a knife there, and I
can soon put you out of the way with that.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Murphy; that won’t do,” said
Parker. “Get back on your horse and let
him go.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t kill him somebody else will,”
said the soldier, very much disappointed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">Page&nbsp;365</span>
hear this order. “He is good for all the men
who can get around him. See that?” he
added, sticking the muzzle of his carbine into
the warrior’s face.</p>

<p>The brave proved that if his legs were shot
through his hands were all right, for he seized
the gun and tried to draw the soldier toward
him. If he had got him within reach of the
knife he held in his hand, he would have
struck him down without mercy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think he ought to be killed
after that?” inquired Murphy.</p>

<p>“We are not here to make war upon crippled
Indians,” said Lieutenant Parker decidedly.
“Disarm him and let him go.”</p>

<p>Now, to Carl it seemed as if it was a matter
of some importance to take away the Indian’s
knife. One of his race, when he becomes
frightened and can run, gets as frightened as
anybody; but when he is wounded so badly
that he is brought to a standstill, he becomes
really a dangerous foe. He will fight as long
as he has strength left to draw a weapon.
The soldier advanced toward him, but his
knife was raised in the most threatening manner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">Page&nbsp;366</span>
But Murphy was equal to the emergency.
In an instant his carbine was poised
in the air; the blow descended, beating down
the Indian’s guard and landing with its full
force on his unprotected head. He was
stretched out as dead, apparently, as any of
the Indians that surrounded him. His muscles
grew rigid, he sank back upon the
ground, and the eyes which had gazed so
ferociously at his assailant became glazed.</p>

<p>“Well, you have killed him now, at all
events,” said the lieutenant in disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir,” said Murphy. “It takes
more than one little whack like that to kill
an Indian. He will come out all right.
Here’s his knife, sir—as a present from me,”
he continued, taking off his hat and giving
the weapon to Parker. “Hold on a minute
and I will get you his scabbard.”</p>

<p>The Indian was too far gone to make any
resistance as he took the sheath and belt off,
and presenting them to Lieutenant Parker, he
mounted his horse and rode back with him to
the camp.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX. <br />Off For Home.</h2>

<p>“Hurry up there, sir. The colonel is
anxious to get all his men in. We
are going to have a blizzard.”</p>

<p>It was Colonel Forsyth’s bugler who hailed
them. He was going over the field in a gallop,
blowing his trumpet as he went, in hope of
getting his men all in camp before the storm
struck them. The lieutenant stopped in surprise
and looked all around him. Sure enough,
there was a blizzard coming. The air was
filled with fine snow which he had not noticed
before; and, now that he began to get over
his excitement, he found that his summer
blouse afforded him but a poor protection
against the wind that was blowing. They put
their horses into a lope in obedience to the
order; but, fast as they went, Lieutenant
Parker took notice of the havoc that was done
by the Hotchkiss guns during the twenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">Page&nbsp;368</span>
minutes that the fight continued. He saw
that there were about as many women dead
as there were men, and that some of them held
repeating rifles in their hands.</p>

<p>“That beats me,” said he, in profound
astonishment. “The squaws meant to fight,
too.”</p>

<p>“You will always find that the case when
troops attack a home camp,” said Carl.
“Some of these women are wounded. They
will freeze to death during this blizzard.”</p>

<p>“That fight was a massacre and nothing
else,” said Parker in disgust. “Why could
not the women have kept out of the way?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose every man on our side
was thinking ‘Remember Custer’ while that
fight took place, sir,” said Murphy, in a tone
which showed that he did not care anything
for the Indians, so long as they were dead.
“I know I did, and I don’t believe that any
Sioux that I pulled on got away.”</p>

<p>The wind continued to increase in fury—so
much so that the notes of the bugle from
the trumpeter who had warned them, and
which he continued to blow at intervals, came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">Page&nbsp;369</span>
but faintly to their ears. Lieutenant Parker
was getting cold, but he did not say a word
about it. His overcoat was left on the ground
where the cavalry began its charge, and if the
colonel did not have anything further for him
to do he would be glad to put that overcoat
on. When they arrived within sight of Colonel
Forsyth’s headquarters they found that
the men who had been recalled by the sound
of the bugle were busy tearing down the tents
and carrying them into the ravine out of
reach of the blizzard, and the rest were working
like beavers to take their dead and wounded
comrades to the same place of refuge. The
officers were working with the men, and if
they said anything at all, it was to urge those
who were laboring with them to hurry a little
faster.</p>

<p>“You are just the man I wanted to see,
Parker,” said his colonel, as he galloped up.
“Hitch your horses there in the gully, and
then you and Murphy get a stretcher and
bring in every man who lost his life during
that fight. Be in a hurry, now, for we don’t
want to leave them out in this wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">Page&nbsp;370</span></p>

<p>“Carl, you go and get our overcoats and
bring one for Murphy,” said Parker, as they
rode away to obey this order. “We can’t
work fast enough to keep warm in this wind.”</p>

<p>“The colonel wants us to bring in every
man who lost his life during the fight,” said
Carl. “He did not say anything about the
Indians, did he?”</p>

<p>“Nary time, sir,” said Murphy, indignantly.
“The Indians brought it all on themselves,
and they can stay there and freeze to death
for all the colonel cares.”</p>

<p>“Another thing,” said the lieutenant—“have
you forgotten what that warrior did
back there on the prairie? Some of the
wounded may have a knife or a rifle, you
know, and it would not be safe to go near
them.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes all our three friends, with
their heavy overcoats and gauntlet gloves on,
were working hard to bring the bodies of their
comrades to the ravine where they would be
out of the way of the blizzard, and as fast as
the men came in they were dispatched to help
them. The lieutenant was astonished when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">Page&nbsp;371</span>
saw how the Indians had used their revolvers
at the beginning of the fight. They had their
pistols and knives hidden under their blankets.
Every one of them went in armed, and that
was the reason they did so much damage.
Some of the Indians and soldiers were almost
touching each other, having fired their guns
when so close together that their garments
were fairly burned with the powder, and of
course it was not possible for one to miss so
large a mark at that distance. The soldiers
did not seem to care a cent for the presence
of the officers who were on the spot to superintend
their operation. If they took hold of
a soldier to place him on a stretcher and an
Indian was in the way, they kicked him
roughly aside, as they would have done with
any other rubbish. The officers noticed it but
did not say anything; and as long as they
ranked Parker, he did not feel called upon to
say anything, either.</p>

<p>“If I had my way they would treat brave
men with a little more respect than that,”
said Parker, as they picked up a soldier who
had been placed upon the stretcher and started
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">Page&nbsp;372</span>
for the ravine with him. “If those men had
not been brave they would not have killed so
many of our fellows.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” muttered Murphy. “They
were fighting for their homes, you know, sir.
Plague take all their homes. They have got
a reservation, and why don’t they go there
and stay upon it? If all the soldiers could
have their way, there would not be one left on
the prairie.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parker was beginning to feel as
Carl, the Trailer, did while he was explaining
the Ghost Dance to him. He felt that the
Indians had been abused, and wished there
was some way in which the matter could be
arranged to everybody’s mutual satisfaction.
But then it would have been of no use to argue
the case with Murphy. Like all soldiers he
had his own opinion, and he would keep on
having it until all the Indians had been wiped
out.</p>

<p>At last, when the blizzard was at its height
and the soldiers could scarcely see which way
to go, the bugle called them in; and when
they got into the ravine all the tents were up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">Page&nbsp;373</span>
and the property they had left on the field
when they began their charge was there under
cover. It was delightful to feel the fire once
more. Their overcoats were frozen stiff, and
it was a long time before they got thawed out
again. The storm lasted three days, and a
severe one it was, too. A soldier would scarcely
stick his head out of his tent before he was
glad to get back by the fire again. Some of
the wounded soldiers died during this time,
and with everyone who breathed his last
among his comrades fierce maledictions went
up on all Indians who were left on the plains.</p>

<p>“I have always said ‘Remember Custer’
when I went into an engagement of this
kind,” said an old soldier, wiping the tears
from his eyes and turning to Lieutenant Parker,
who had come into the hospital tent just
in time to see a wounded man breathe his
last, “but from now on I shall yell ‘Remember
Simpson.’ He met his death like a
brave man.”</p>

<p>“Was he shot?” asked Parker, who knew
he ought to say something to show that he
sympathized with the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">Page&nbsp;374</span></p>

<p>“No, sir. He shot that brave down, and
thought he had him sure enough; but he had
a knife, with which he struck Simpson in the
side. My rifle was loaded, and I will bet you
he did not hurt anybody after that. Oh yes,
I shall always remember Simpson.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day after the
blizzard the sun rose bright and clear, and the
work of burying the dead Indians began. All
hands were turned out for that purpose.
Some dug a ditch large enough to hold them
all, and the rest were sent out to gather up
the men, women and children, some lying at
least two miles away, and bring them to the
grave. The unfeeling soldiers dumped them
into the trench like so many sticks of wood,
while Lieutenant Parker and Carl stood by
with their hands clenched and their teeth
shut firmly against each other. If Parker
had been in command of that squad they
would have handled the Indians with much
more respect.</p>

<p>The lieutenant noticed that more than half
the Indians were stripped when they arrived
at the trench; but the officers, although they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">Page&nbsp;375</span>
saw it, did not make any remark. What the
soldiers wanted as much as anything else was
to secure the ghost shirts on which so much
depended, and these they had taken off when
they first found the Indians and stowed away
under their overcoats. He gave up all hope
of getting one of these ghost shirts; but that
night, when the officers were all in their tents
preparing to smoke, after supper, Carl came
to the door and called him out. He went,
and was presented with one of the ghost shirts
that the medicine man had blessed, and which
was to render the soldiers weak and powerless.</p>

<p>“I knew you would not have a chance to
get one with those officers all around you, and
so I went off and got this myself,” said Carl.
“See there. That is the place where the
bullet went in, and you can see how much resistance
the shirt offered to it. He might as
well have gone into the fight with nothing on
at all.”</p>

<p>The next day this work was done and the
Indians were buried; but the work of the
cavalry was not yet over. They were ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">Page&nbsp;376</span>
away in haste to help a company of buffalo
soldiers (negroes) who were coming into the
agency with a train load of supplies. But
this fight did not last long. The cavalry
charged the Indians as soon as they caught
sight of them, and ran them off to the hills.
They did not lose a man, but the Sioux lost
four warriors and several ponies. And so it
was during the three weeks they stayed there,
and it was not until January that they received
orders to go to the fort.</p>

<p>“I have learned something since I have
been here,” said the lieutenant, when the
soldiers were fairly under way to go to their
post. “I did not know why they called this
battle ‘Wounded Knee,’ but now I know.
There is an agency a few miles up the creek
called Wounded Knee, and it is situated on a
stream of the same name. Everything is
Wounded Knee up this way.”</p>

<p>“Say, Parker, I will tell you what I have
been thinking of for the last few days,” said
Carl. “Do you think you behaved yourself
in that fight so that the colonel will give you
leave of absence for a week?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">Page&nbsp;377</span></p>

<p>“What are you up to?” asked Parker, who
knew that Carl had made up his mind to go
somewhere, and that he wanted the lieutenant
to go with him. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am going out to my house to see how
the fellows there came out during the war,”
said Carl. “They don’t know that the war is
ended, and there may have been some raiders
who went up to the ranch from Standing
Rock Agency.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask the colonel,” said Parker, who
was delighted with the thought of being free
from all military duty for the time he had
mentioned. “I have been here eighteen
months, and I have never asked for a furlough.
I think he will let me go.”</p>

<p>“Well, when we get back to the fort we
will wait a little while until the excitement
dies out, and when I tip you the wink, you go
and see him.”</p>

<p>But Carl did not wait as long as he thought
he was going to. On the next night but one
they came within sight of the stockade, and
Carl was thunderstruck and alarmed, too, when
one of the officers pointed out to him a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">Page&nbsp;378</span>
herd of cattle that were feeding close by the
fort. Something told him whose cattle those
were, and it took him but a few minutes to
ride up and look at the brand on their flanks.
The herd belonged to him, but he could not
see signs of any herdsmen who had come there
with them.</p>

<p>“Those are some of my cattle,” said he to
Parker when he rode up beside him, “but
how in the world did they come down here?
That captain the colonel left here to command
the post during his absence is a brick. He
has some of the teamsters and soldiers out
there to see that they don’t stray away. I am
going home this very night.”</p>

<p>“Not alone, are you?” said Parker, becoming
alarmed in his turn. “You may find
some Indians there who have left your ranch
a pile of ruins.”</p>

<p>“I have to go, at any rate. I will speak to
the colonel before I leave. If he has a mind
to send a company of men out there with me——”</p>

<p>“Ask for Company D,” said Parker.</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely that he will give me a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">Page&nbsp;379</span>
chance to ask for any company, but I shall be
glad to have one.”</p>

<p>Carl rode off to hunt up the colonel, who
had by this time dismounted in front of his
quarters, who listened in surprise when he
told him of the discovery he had made. He
did not hesitate a minute, but called to his
adjutant to start off Company D, as soon as
they had time to refresh themselves and
horses, to see what had been going on at
Carl’s ranch.</p>

<p>“It is a pity, Carl, that they took this time
to raid you,” said the colonel. “But I will do
what I can to get your cattle back and punish
the fellows who had a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“It is all right,” said Carl, who was sitting
on his horse at the rear of the column. “You
will get your orders in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Bully for the colonel,” said Parker, never
once turning his eyes toward the speaker.</p>

<p>Company D was drawn up in line all
ready to be dismissed, but the adjutant
ordered them a few paces to the front and directed
them to move off on the right and come
to a front again. The line closed up and the

other companies broke ranks, and then the
adjutant repeated the colonel’s order, after
which this company was also dismissed, and
started to take their horses to the stable.</p>

<p>“What’s up, sir?” whispered Murphy.</p>

<p>“Those are my cattle out there, and we are
going up to see what has become of those fellows
who had charge of them,” said Carl, who
did not speak as he usually did. “I am
afraid the Sioux have bounced them.”</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” said Murphy. “Here goes
for another fight with the Indians!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI. <br />Conclusion.</h2>

<p>Carl was very much depressed when he
went into the teamsters’ quarters to get
his supper. The men wanted to talk about
the battle, but Carl wanted some information
about his cattle. How long had they been
there? Did anybody come with them? And
did they run as though they were very much
frightened about something? The teamsters
answered these questions as well as they could,
but they were certain about two things: nobody
had been seen with the cattle when they came
up, and they were running as though they
had made up their minds not to stop until
they reached the Mississippi River. But they
were easily controlled, and the men who had
been sent after them had no trouble at all in
driving them back to the fort.</p>

<p>“Now, Carl, tell us something more about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">Page&nbsp;382</span>
the fight,” said one of the teamsters. “How
did Lieutenant Parker behave, any way?”</p>

<p>“He acted as though there was not an
Indian within a hundred miles of him,” answered
Carl with animation. “He let his
horse take his own way, and never stopped
until we were a mile away from the camp.”</p>

<p>“Did he kill any Indians?”</p>

<p>“Every time I saw him pull on an Indian,
he dropped. But he saved one Sioux from
being killed, and that’s one thing I didn’t
like about him.”</p>

<p>While Carl was engaged in telling this
story about the Indian who was shot through
both legs and had a knife left with which to
defend himself, the bugle sounded, and that
was something that Carl delighted to hear.
He hurried out to get his horse, and when he
came back the men were all drawn up in line
and the captain was listening to some parting
instructions from the colonel.</p>

<p>“If you see any signs of the Sioux out there,
you will follow them up until you are certain
that they go on their reservation,” said he.
“Carl, I hope it is not as bad as you think,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">Page&nbsp;383</span>
he added, turning to the young scout, who
came up at that moment. “A boy who behaved
as you did in the fight don’t deserve to
have his ranch raided. Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the column, headed
by Carl and the captain, were out of the gate,
and the darkness shut them out from view.
For miles they travelled at a fast walk, and
not a word was said by anybody in the ranks.
Finally Carl, who had been watching his
horse for some time, stopped his own nag and
reached out and touched the captain on the
shoulder. There was somebody coming, and
he was coming fast, too. In a few seconds
more he caught sight of two or three hats
which were bobbing back and forth in front
of the horizon, and in response to the captain’s
challenge they hauled up very suddenly.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who comes there?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“Halt yourself,” answered a voice; and
Carl was almost ready to yell when he recognized
that Thompson was speaking to them.
“You are soldiers, ain’t you? Have you seen
any cattle down this way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">Page&nbsp;384</span></p>

<p>“Thompson!” cried Carl.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare; if there ain’t Carl,” said
Thompson, so delighted that he could scarcely
speak. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“I have been in a fight, but I am all here
yet,” said Carl, riding forward to shake his
men by the hand. “How did those cattle
manage to get away from you?”</p>

<p>“You have been in a fight, have you?”
said Thompson, so overjoyed to see Carl again
that he could hardly let him go. “Well, you
haven’t been in any worse one than we have.
We’ve killed nine Indians, and have a prisoner
up there to show you.”</p>

<p>“A prisoner? Who is it?”</p>

<p>“It is Harding—that is who it is. He
came out to the ranch with twenty-five Indians
to gather up some stock, and we were
too many for him. He stampeded some of the
cattle, but we whipped the Indians and drove
them away.”</p>

<p>“That is the same thing he proposed to me
while I was a prisoner,” said Carl, turning to
the captain. “I knew that if I gave him an
order on Thompson for the stock he would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">Page&nbsp;385</span>
killed when he presented it. Well, he helped
me to escape once, and you can help him this
time.”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!” exclaimed the captain.
“General Miles has ordered every soldier
in his department to arrest that fellow,
and he will have to go to the fort with me.”</p>

<p>“That is what I say, captain,” said Thompson.
“He tried to rob our safe, too.”</p>

<p>“We will go back to the fort now and report
to the colonel,” added the captain. “If he
chooses to send us up there to-morrow, why
we will get him. What are you going to do
with your men, Carl?”</p>

<p>“They will go to the fort with us and be
ready to come back with the cattle to-morrow.
The soldiers and teamsters rounded them up
for you, and I guess they are all there,” he
continued, addressing himself to Thompson.
“I am surprised at you,” he continued, when
the captain had brought the men around and
headed them toward the fort. “I am sorry I
told you so much.”</p>

<p>“Now, Carl, see here,” said Thompson,
lowering his voice almost to a whisper. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">Page&nbsp;386</span>
need not have him captured unless you want
to.”</p>

<p>“How shall we prevent it? The colonel
will send some men to the ranch to-morrow,
and when they get their hands on him he is
booked for the military prison at Leavenworth.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Thompson, lowering his
voice so that no one but Carl could hear it.
“I have six men with me, and how does this
captain know but I have a hundred? Send
Bert back and tell him to escape. I’ll bet
you that they won’t see him after that.”</p>

<p>It would seem from this that Carl kept the
ranchmen posted on everything that happened
to him at the fort. When he came
home after his captivity among the Sioux, he
told them all that occurred to him—how
Harding had threatened to shoot him because
of the death of Sitting Bull, but had suddenly
grown merciful to him when he saw that the
Indians were determined to have revenge on
him, and how he had assisted him to keep out
of their way. Thompson felt kinder toward
Harding after that, and so did all the herdsmen;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">Page&nbsp;387</span>
and when they found that Carl was
anxious to have him escape, there was not one
man who had a word to say against it.</p>

<p>“Well, go and tell Bert to come here,” said
Carl, after thinking a moment. “You know
what sort of a guard he is under, don’t you?
Now you tell him how you will arrange it.”</p>

<p>Thompson reined in his horse, and was
gone but a few moments when he rode up
again with Bert at his side. In a few whispered
words he told Bert just what he had to
do, and he understood it. He was pulling up
his horse to let the column get a little in advance
of him, when Carl said earnestly:</p>

<p>“Tell him that this is the last time I shall
befriend him. He helped me to escape once
when I stood a chance of being staked out,
and now I have paid him back. If he ever
gets into trouble with the soldiers again, he
will have to stand the result of his misdeeds.”</p>

<p>The captain did not know how many men
were with Thompson, and consequently he
did not miss one of their number, who was
going at his best pace toward the ranch to
warn the squawman that the soldiers were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">Page&nbsp;388</span>
coming to-morrow to arrest him. As Thompson
had said, “You would not see him very
much after that.” If he once got out of that
ranch and felt a good horse under him, he
would kill him before he would ever be found
in that department again.</p>

<p>The column pursued their way at an easy
gait, and when they came within sight of the
cattle, Thompson and his men went down to
relieve the teamsters and soldiers who had been
keeping guard over them, and the rest rode
on into the fort. Some few of the teamsters
were awake as Carl went in, and wanted to
know all about it; but the young scout told
them that the Sioux had been whipped, and
had made their way back to their reservation.</p>

<p>The next morning Carl arose at an early
hour, but his cattle were nowhere in sight.
Thompson had routed his men up as soon as
they could see their way clearly, and had
started the cattle back toward home. Carl
now wanted to see the colonel. He wanted
to know if there was anything for him to do,
otherwise he desired to go home and look
after things there. But the colonel did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">Page&nbsp;389</span>
appear until near breakfast time; then, the
captain having made his report to him, he
sent for Carl. He said that he was perfectly
willing that Carl should go and stay as long
as he wanted to, but that Harding must be
brought back.</p>

<p>“Your men have got him where they can
hold him, have they?” asked the commander.
“He is a mighty slippery fellow, and if he
sees the least chance to get away he is going
to improve it. I had him here in the fort
once, and how he got away beats me. I will
send a sergeant and four men with you to
take him.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Carl. He did not
say that the men would find him there, for he
was quite sure they would not. He waited
until the men got ready and then mounted
his horse, which he had ridden during the fight,
and started off on the trail of the cattle. In
about three hours they overtook them.
Thompson was bringing up the rear, and his
face was all wrinkled up with smiles when he
caught sight of the sergeant and four soldiers.</p>

<p>“Say,” said he, “when you get that fellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">Page&nbsp;390</span>
I want you to hold fast to him. This is the
second time he has bothered me, and I ain’t
agoing to put up with it much longer.”</p>

<p>They had a long way to go, and late in the
afternoon they came within sight of the ranch.
There was no one there to receive them, but
Carl did not mind that. He showed the
soldiers where to put their horses, for they
were going to stay with him all night, and
then led the way into the hall.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to see Harding the
first thing you do,” said he. “Well, he is in
the office here——Why, what in the world
does this mean?”</p>

<p>He had come to the door of the office, but
it was wide open. The key was on the outside,
and the window was open, too. There was
the shakedown in which the squawman had
spent the first night of his captivity, but that
was the only thing they saw of him.</p>

<p>“He has escaped!” said Carl; and one, to
have seen him, would have thought that it
was a matter that crushed him completely.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he has escaped,” said the cook,
who, hearing the sound of their footsteps in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">Page&nbsp;391</span>
the hall, had come in from the kitchen to see
what was the matter, “and I would like to
know if anybody ever got away under such
circumstances before. We had one man outside
here in the hall, and another out by the
window. They were cautioned to look out for
him, for he was like an eel—a hard fellow to
hold. Well, sir, that man outside went away
for about five minutes, and when he came
back the window was open and Harding was
gone. He took Thompson’s best horse, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, that lets us off,” said the sergeant,
looking around at the soldiers. “Can’t we
follow him up and catch him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the cook. “Don’t I tell you
that he has the best horse on the ranch?
Some of the men are out now looking for
him. He didn’t take to the prairie, but concealed
himself in the mountains. He won’t
come out till he gets among his friends.”</p>

<p>The cook spoke so earnestly, and seemed so
disgusted over Harding’s escape, that the sergeant
never thought to blame him for it. If
the truth must be told, he was the man who
brought the horse and tied him to the bushes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">Page&nbsp;392</span>
in the yard so that the squawman could readily
find him, and he stood in his door and saw
Harding leap out of the window, mount the
nag, and ride away in the darkness. Some
of the men were indeed out, but they were
not looking for Harding. They were attending
to the cattle.</p>

<p>“I think we will go back and report to the
colonel,” said the sergeant, after meditating a
few moments. “He ought to know that he
ain’t going to get the man.”</p>

<p>And we may add that this was the last adventure
that befell Carl while he stayed at
the fort. The troops never suspected Carl,
and neither did they ever see Harding again.
What became of him after that nobody knew.
Of course the soldiers were all on the lookout
for him, but he disappeared completely. And
we may go further, and say that no one on
the ranch ever heard of Claude again. A
young man with such habits as his don’t often
turn out to be anybody in the world. If he
keeps such company as the two men who
attempted to rob Carl of his money, he is
probably in State’s prison before this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">Page&nbsp;393</span></p>

<p>The sergeant and all the soldiers were surprised
and perplexed over the escape of Harding,
and when the horses had had a rest and
the men had eaten their supper they set out
for the fort. The men stood on the porch
and saw them go; and when they had got
out of sight the cook turned to Carl, laid one
finger alongside his nose, and winked first one
eye and then the other. If the sergeant had
seen that motion he might have been led to
suspect something.</p>

<p>Carl, the Trailer, remained at home for a
week, and when he started for the fort again
he took a big load from Thompson’s mind by
telling him that he had seen all the scouting
he wanted to see, and that in a few days he
was coming home to remain.</p>

<p>“There is no more fight in the Sioux, for,
now that Sitting Bull has gone and Big Foot
was killed during that fight, there will be no
one to take command of them,” said Carl.
“But first I want to bring the lieutenant up
here, to let him see how I live when I am at
home. I will come back in a week or two,
and I shall never go away again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">Page&nbsp;394</span></p>

<p>The men were all glad to hear that piece
of news, and when Carl returned in company
with the lieutenant, they extended to him a
hearty welcome; for Carl had told his herdsmen
how he behaved in that fight with the
Sioux, and they were glad to shake a brave
man by the hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you wanted to leave this
nice place, where you have everything just as
you want it, and come down to the fort to go
scouting,” said Parker, when he had been
shown about the ranch, and supper was over
and the men had gathered on the porch. “If
I had a ranch like this I would resign in a
minute. I never would go on another hunt
after Indians.”</p>

<p>That was what his men all said, and they
were glad to welcome him home. Carl still
lives on the plains, but he does not go down
to the fort as much as he used to. Time has
made changes, and there are but few officers
left who knew him as Carl, the Trailer.
Parker has now become a captain, and has
been ordered to the coast. He keeps up a
regular correspondence with Carl; and of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">Page&nbsp;395</span>
the stories he has to tell to his younger officers,
there are none that he takes so much delight
in as those in which the young scout was engaged.
The Ghost Dance is a thing of the
past. It has never been heard of since Yellow
Bird caught up that handful of dust and
threw it into the air, which started the massacre
of Wounded Knee.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
